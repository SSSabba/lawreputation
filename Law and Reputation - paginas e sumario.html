<p><span class="font1">How the Legal System Shapes Behavior by Producing Information</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">L AW A N D R E P U T A T I O N</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">The legal system affects behavior not just directly, by imposing sanctions, but also indirectly, by producing information on how people behave. For example,&nbsp;internal company documents exposed during litigation will help third parties&nbsp;assess whether they trust a company and want to keep doing business with it.&nbsp;The law therefore affects behavior by shaping reputations. Drawing on&nbsp;economics, communications, and a nascent multidisciplinary literature on&nbsp;reputation, Roy Shapira highlights how reputation works, and how information&nbsp;from the courtroom affects the court of public opinion, with a particular&nbsp;emphasis on the role of the media. By fleshing out interactions between law and&nbsp;reputation, Shapira corrects common misperceptions about the ability of market&nbsp;forces to discipline corporate behavior and adds to timely, ongoing debates such&nbsp;as the desirability of heightened pleading standards or mandatory arbitration&nbsp;clauses. </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Law andReputation</span><span class="font21"> should interest any scholar who invokes notions of&nbsp;market discipline in their work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Roy Shapira is at the Harry Radzyner Law School, Interdisciplinary Center (IDC), Herzliya. He has focused on the interactions between law and reputation&nbsp;over the past decade: teaching it at Harvard Economics Department, consulting&nbsp;on it for private firms, and publishing in various law reviews and business&nbsp;publications.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font25" style="font-style:italic;">Acknowledgments</span></h3>
<p><span class="font21">This book’s core insight was developed during my SJD years at Harvard Law School, and I am indebted to the many who facilitated my growth there. First&nbsp;and foremost, my academic supervisors - Mark Roe, Lucian Bebchuk, and&nbsp;Robert Clark - were a fantastic source of feedback and inspiration. The school’s&nbsp;graduate program provided financial and academic support. And many other&nbsp;faculty members, particularly Jesse Fried and Steve Shavell, were kind enough&nbsp;to offer a constant, high-quality sounding board. The eclectic nature of my work&nbsp;pushed me to interact also with many outside the law school, and I specifically&nbsp;thank the late Richard Hackman for his feedback on the social psychology&nbsp;angles presented here. Finally, Jeff Miron and the Economics Department gave&nbsp;me the opportunity to hone my ideas by teaching a seminar on them at Harvard&nbsp;College for six years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Following the completion of my doctoral dissertation, I worked as a consultant on corporate reputation, mostly with Reputation Institute. Working&nbsp;there has greatly benefited my perspective on how law and reputation interact,&nbsp;infusing the abstract nature of my ideas with a much-needed reality check. I have&nbsp;also served as a research director at the Stigler Center at the University of&nbsp;Chicago’s Booth School of Business, and learned many valuable lessons there,&nbsp;both substantive and methodological. I am specifically indebted to Guy Rolnik&nbsp;for his on-the-ground insights on political economy and the role of the media,&nbsp;and to Luigi Zingales, who headed the center, for giving me the opportunity and&nbsp;for providing a rare blueprint for academic work that is both rigorous and&nbsp;accessible. In the last couple of years I have been a part of the Interdisciplinary&nbsp;Center’s (IDC) Law School in Israel, where I enjoyed the support of Dean&nbsp;Amnon Lehavi and all other faculty members, with Amir Licht providing&nbsp;constant feedback on all matters corporate governance and beyond.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Numerous colleagues have read drafts or offered advice in various stages of the project.

<h2><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Introduction</span></h2>
<p><span class="font21">Back in 2009 when I was starting my doctoral studies, I sat through my first ever law and economics seminar. Two of the field’s founding fathers - Polinsky and&nbsp;Shavell - were presenting their proposal to abolish product liability.<sup>1</sup> A heated&nbsp;debate over the outcomes ensued in the room: how abolishing liability could&nbsp;affect access to justice or distribution. But I was still stuck on the logic, namely,&nbsp;how Polinsky and Shavell treated reputation as an alternative to the legal system.&nbsp;Manufacturers, their argument went, will invest in the quality and safety of their&nbsp;products even without the threat of legal liability, simply because they care&nbsp;about maintaining their reputation. And in markets where these nonlegal&nbsp;(reputational) forces are strong enough, it is not cost-effective to keep a costly&nbsp;adjudication system merely for the sake of an incremental contribution to&nbsp;deterrence. Reputation serves as justification for reducing legal intervention. A&nbsp;quick search revealed that such reputation-instead-of-litigation logic is actually&nbsp;prevalent in economic analysis across various legal fields. I then realized what&nbsp;was bothering me about the logic, and found my academic calling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">At the heart of the argument lies an implicit assumption that the legal system and the nonlegal system are independent of each other. Law and&nbsp;economics scholars were assuming that we can remove the law - remove the&nbsp;background threat of litigation - and the market forces will continue to function&nbsp;just the same. But in reality the strength of market forces is (among other things)&nbsp;a function of the existing legal system. If we remove the background threat of&nbsp;litigation, reputational sanctions may become more strident.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">This book represents the culmination of my efforts in the decade that has passed since that law and economics seminar to better understand the&nbsp;interactions between legal and reputational systems. The book makes three&nbsp;major contributions, along the following dimensions: how reputation works, how&nbsp;the law interacts with reputation, and how a social planner can harness these&nbsp;interactions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">First, the book shows that </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">nonlegal systems of control are costly too (just less transparently so).</span><span class="font21"> Legal scholars are usually aware of the costs of legal&nbsp;systems, and can relatively easily quantify them. But the costs of nonlegal&nbsp;systems are less transparent to us, and we tend to underplay them.<sup>2</sup> This is&nbsp;especially true for reputational systems, where the legal literature suffers from an&nbsp;“indefensible optimism about the actual operation of information markets.’- The&nbsp;legal and economic literature often treat reputation as a straightforward, binary&nbsp;process: if you misbehave, your future business opportunities diminish; if you&nbsp;behave well, your future business opportunities flourish. This book draws from&nbsp;an emerging interdisciplinary body of research to show that in reality reputation&nbsp;is rather inherently noisy. Market players often lack the incentives and&nbsp;information needed to accurately update their willingness to do business with the&nbsp;company in question. As a result, the market systematically overreacts to certain&nbsp;types of behaviors, and underreacts to others. Stakeholders may stop doing&nbsp;business with perfectly fine companies or ignore warning signals and continue&nbsp;doing business with rotten companies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Second, </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Law and Reputation</span><span class="font21"> fleshes out how </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">the effectiveness of nonlegal systems is affected by the legal system,</span><span class="font21"> and vice versa. Reputational sanctioning&nbsp;does not operate in a vacuum. The same bad news that ignites an initial market&nbsp;reaction may also get the legal system involved in litigation or regulatory&nbsp;investigations. Then, in the process of determining whether to impose legal&nbsp;sanctions, the legal system produces as a by-product information on the behavior&nbsp;of the parties to the dispute: what top managers knew about the problem, when&nbsp;they knew it, whether they could have stopped it, and so forth. This information&nbsp;is available to outside observers and affects the way that these third parties treat&nbsp;the parties to the dispute. In other words, the legal system provides better&nbsp;information to the public for them to base reputational judgments on. Law and&nbsp;reputation are not independent of each other, but rather complement each other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Finally, recognizing the informational role that the law plays in facilitating reputational sanctions carries important policy implications. On a general level,&nbsp;the book calls for a more cautious approach to advocating for nonintervention.&nbsp;Scaling back litigation or regulation may have the unintended consequences of&nbsp;raising the costs of nonlegal sanctions. On a more specific level, the book uses&nbsp;the reputational framework to reevaluate key doctrines according to how they&nbsp;contribute to the quality and quantity of information produced. In the process we&nbsp;get to revisit timely questions such as the desirability of the recent wave of&nbsp;mandatory arbitration provisions, the proper scope of the judicial review of the&nbsp;Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) actions, and whether to assess&nbsp;director liability individually or collectively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The broad focus of this book is </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">diffusion of information.</span><span class="font21"> Business law scholars tend to rely on classical economics and agency theory, and this focus&nbsp;has hindered them from grappling with informational issues: market players are&nbsp;assumed either to have information or not to have it. </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Law and Reputation</span><span class="font21"> shifts&nbsp;our focus to questions such as how information is diffused (contrary to popular&nbsp;belief, information does not fall on individuals like manna from heaven), what is&nbsp;the role of information intermediaries such as mass media, and what types of&nbsp;messages are perceived as being more credible than others. For example, the&nbsp;book conducts content analyses of prizewinning investigative reports, showing&nbsp;how and how much these impactful media stories relied on Information coming&nbsp;from the legal system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">This chapter proceeds in three parts. The first provides an overview of the main themes and questions that motivate each chapter The second explains the&nbsp;methodology - how I approached the questions. The third clarifies the scope of&nbsp;inquiry and original contributions, by juxtaposing my arguments with the extant&nbsp;related literature.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">OverView</span></h4>
<p><span class="font21">The book lays out the theory of law and reputation (</span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapters 1</span><span class="font21">-2), applies the theory to specific legal fields (</span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapters 3</span><span class="font21">-6), and offers big-picture policy&nbsp;implications (</span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapters 7</span><span class="font21">-8).</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 1</span><span class="font21"> starts with the basic questions of what reputation is and why it is noisy. Why do similar behaviors lead to different reputational outcomes?&nbsp;Everyday experience and systematic empirical evidence tell us that not all bad&nbsp;news is created equal. Some companies and businessmen emerge from failures&nbsp;unscathed while others go bankrupt. To better understand why the market reacts&nbsp;negatively to some bad news but not to others, we need to break the process of&nbsp;reputational sanctioning into its different components, and reveal how noisy it is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The first component is those who dispense reputational sanctions (the company stakeholders: consumers, workers, investors, and so on). Stakeholders&nbsp;often do not have enough information to judge correctly what happened and how&nbsp;it happened. Even when stakeholders do have information, many times they&nbsp;ignore it or process it imperfectly due to well-documented behavioral biases&nbsp;such as focusing too much on available and salient issues. The second&nbsp;component of reputational sanctioning is intermediaries who disseminate&nbsp;information on corporate behavior, such as mass media or corporate watchdogs.&nbsp;These intermediaries have incentives to cater to their audiences’ biases. They&nbsp;tend to exaggerate certain criticisms and downplay others, as a function of what&nbsp;sells newspapers or attracts donors and volunteers. Finally, those who are&nbsp;sanctioned - the companies themselves - invest heavily in distorting the&nbsp;information environment with tactics such as smokescreens and scapegoating.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Evidence is thus mounting that the market, when left alone, has trouble calibrating reputational sanctions/rewards correctly. But in reality the market is&nbsp;rarely left alone. In reality reputation operates in the shadow of the law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">This is where </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 2</span><span class="font21"> enters, explaining how the law affects reputation. If you read only one chapter of this book (a pity), read this one, as it contains the&nbsp;core elements of the arguments that appear throughout. The law affects&nbsp;reputation in various ways. First, it reveals new damning information about the&nbsp;misbehavior of powerful players in society. The legal system confers fact-generating powers on litigants, judges, and investigators. As a result, the legal&nbsp;system often gives stakeholders access to facts that they were not privy to when&nbsp;they initially reacted. Think, for example, of internal email communications&nbsp;exposed during the discovery stage, showing how top managers knew but did&nbsp;not stop the misconduct. The law can also affect stakeholders’ beliefs without&nbsp;producing any new information, simply by shaping the saliency, credibility, and&nbsp;framing of issues in stakeholders’ minds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">In particular, the law shapes the scope and tone of media coverage. </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter </span><span class="font21">2 presents evidence gathered by interviewing forty investigative reporters, going&nbsp;over members-only databases of reporters’ tip sheets and how-to manuals,&nbsp;comparing course syllabi in leading communication schools, and conducting&nbsp;content analysis of prizewinning investigative projects from the past twenty&nbsp;years. The triangulation of these methods yields a clear conclusion: in today’s&nbsp;world, legal sources - court documents, regulatory reports, freedom-of-information requests - are the single most important source of investigative&nbsp;reporting. The law facilitates effective media scrutiny, which in turn facilitates&nbsp;effective reputational deterrence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 2</span><span class="font21"> then provides a blueprint to applying the law-and-reputation framework to specific legal fields and situations. The key insight is that&nbsp;information flows from the courtroom to the court of public opinion in&nbsp;counterintuitive ways, which need to be taken into account before applying the&nbsp;theory. Not every legal dispute affects reputation. And when they do, they do not&nbsp;necessarily hurt it - some actually improve the disputants’ reputation. For&nbsp;example, judicial scolding sometimes helps a defendant company recover its lost&nbsp;reputation, by creating scapegoating dynamics (singling out an individual&nbsp;manager for opprobrium). Thus, companies often lose the legal battle but win the&nbsp;reputational battle, and vice versa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 3</span><span class="font21"> starts the applications part of the book with the most natural candidate: fiduciary duty litigation in corporate law. Directors of publicly traded&nbsp;companies are more likely to get struck by lightning than pay legal fines for&nbsp;mismanaging their company. Acknowledging this curious feature of corporate&nbsp;law - the lack of direct sanctions - has led corporate legal scholars to look at the&nbsp;law’s indirect effects on nonlegal sanctions and rewards. But so far most&nbsp;accounts have dealt only with how corporate litigation shapes </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">morals.</span><span class="font21"> Under the&nbsp;prevalent approach, judges who scold misbehaving managers make directors&nbsp;internalize better norms of behavior (framing effects) or behave better out of fear&nbsp;of social disapproval from their peers (shaming effects). The problem with&nbsp;existing accounts is that they focus solely on what judges say rather than on what&nbsp;relevant audiences - the directors themselves, their peers, and the public at large&nbsp;- actually hear. Analyses of the content of media coverage and law firm memos&nbsp;show that in reality moral rebukes often get lost in translation and do not reach&nbsp;their presumed audiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">In effect, the main function of corporate law is not to shape moral beliefs (finger-wagging theory) but rather to shape factual beliefs (information-production theory). By shifting the focus to information production, we get a&nbsp;fresh perspective on much-debated features of Delaware corporate law, such as&nbsp;the increased reliance on open-ended standards and the</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">liberal use of shareholders’ inspection rights, both being doctrines that boost the amount and quality of information production.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 4</span><span class="font21"> shifts our attention from private litigation to public enforcement, within the context of the SEC’s settlement practices, which became the center of&nbsp;national debate in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. While the existing&nbsp;debate revolves around the amount of money being paid or admissions being&nbsp;collected, the reputational framework offers an alternative way to measure the&nbsp;effectiveness of SEC enforcement. The real problem with SEC settlements is not&nbsp;that the SEC leaves money on the table, but rather that the SEC leaves&nbsp;information on the table. Both the SEC and big-firm defendants have incentives&nbsp;to settle quickly and for high amounts, in exchange for limiting the public&nbsp;release of damning information. Such information-underproduction dynamics&nbsp;are good for both parties but bad for society at large. The reputational framework&nbsp;helps us identify solutions, like evaluating the proper scope of the judicial&nbsp;review of SEC actions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 5</span><span class="font21"> switches focus from reputational sanctions to reputational rewards. Why do business companies donate to charity? One possibility is that&nbsp;charitable donations serve as a signaling device: by sacrificing profits in the&nbsp;public interest the company conveys messages about its fundamentals. Think, for&nbsp;example, of cash donations as a handicap: when we observe a company&nbsp;substantially increasing its cash donations, we infer that the firm’s insiders&nbsp;perceive its future to be good enough to spend these ultra-discretionary funds. In&nbsp;other words, corporate philanthropy is not so much about gaining a reputation&nbsp;for being nice, but rather about gaining a reputation for being financially sound.&nbsp;But corporate philanthropy is not just about signaling or goodwill, and is not&nbsp;unequivocally good for the company. Corporate managers have both the will and&nbsp;the means to strategically select the levels and targets of corporate charity in&nbsp;order to entrench themselves at the expense of shareholders and society at large.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Donations to directors’ pet charities can co-opt board independence requirements. And donations to certain educational charities can bypass money-in-politics restrictions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The theoretical arguments on how philanthropy can be good (signaling) or bad (co-optation) for the company strengthen the case for introducing some form&nbsp;of mandatory disclosure. In fact, corporate philanthropy practices around the&nbsp;world serve as a great laboratory to test the reputational theory of the law: they&nbsp;provide a counterfactual, namely, an environment beyond the shadow of the law.&nbsp;In the United States, for example, there is no legal intervention in corporate&nbsp;niceness - not even a requirement to disclose how much or to whom you donate.&nbsp;The regulatory vacuum leads to a “cheap talk” reputation environment:&nbsp;companies get credit for being socially responsible regardless of their actions.&nbsp;Enron, for instance, won numerous accolades for corporate social responsibility&nbsp;in the years leading up to its collapse. By contrast, in countries that introduce&nbsp;some form of standardized, subject-to-legal-liability mandatory reporting,&nbsp;reputation rewarding becomes more accurate. Two opposite experiences in the&nbsp;United Kingdom and Israel illustrate. Israel enacted in 2003 mandatory&nbsp;disclosure of corporate philanthropy, while the United Kingdom dropped its&nbsp;mandatory disclosure requirement in 2013. The chapter uses evidence from these&nbsp;semi-natural experiments to show that the shadow of the law affects both actual&nbsp;behaviors (how much and to whom companies donate) and perceptions (stock&nbsp;price reactions).</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 6</span><span class="font21"> takes the theory outside of its comfort zone, applying it to regulatory behavior. Can judicial review effectively check regulators’ behaviors?&nbsp;The answer largely depends on how regulators behave - what motivates them. If,&nbsp;as in traditional economic theory, regulators mostly maximize their narrow self-interest, then there is little that judicial review can do to stop regulatory capture.&nbsp;Judges may invalidate specific regulatory decisions after the fact, but they&nbsp;cannot overcome the inherent advantages that special interests enjoy in the way&nbsp;of offering lucrative future business opportunities or campaign financing. If,&nbsp;however, regulators care not just about material incentives, but also about their&nbsp;reputation, then judicial review can shape regulators’ behavior indirectly, by&nbsp;providing information on how regulators behave. Regardless of whether courts&nbsp;intervene and strike down specific regulatory decisions or not, the process of&nbsp;litigation can generate reputational pressures that propel the regulators to change&nbsp;their behavior. Judicial review mitigates the risks of regulatory capture not so&nbsp;much through modifying regulators’ material incentives, as through shaping the&nbsp;public’s perceptions of regulators.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">A burgeoning political science literature empirically documents how regulators proactively react to what the media writes about them. If the media&nbsp;agenda dictates regulatory behavior, then a key question becomes what shapes&nbsp;the media agenda. Here as well, a large part of the answer is litigation. In&nbsp;administrative litigation, for example, regulators are required to provide detailed&nbsp;explanations for why they decided the way they did, and judges provide their&nbsp;own, hard-look assessment of the regulator’s competence and integrity. Still,&nbsp;public litigation is limited in its ability to effect change through reputational&nbsp;pressure, for reasons that include the legal doctrine and the (low) saliency of&nbsp;issues. This is why in many instances the real impact on regulators’ reputation&nbsp;comes from a less intuitive channel: private litigation to which the regulator is&nbsp;not even privy. Think about a scenario of mass tort litigation between a polluting&nbsp;plant and victims who live in proximity to the plant. Such litigation may reveal&nbsp;information on how the defendant company skirted environmental regulation&nbsp;and got away with it. The litigation may thus affect not just the defendant&nbsp;company’s reputation, but also the regulator’s reputation, raising questions about&nbsp;how the regulator let the pollution happen under her not-so-watchful eye.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapters 7</span><span class="font21"> and 8 sketch big-picture policy implications that cut across legal fields. </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 7</span><span class="font21"> cautions us from taking the law-as-facilitating-reputational-deterrence function as given. For law to affect reputation meaningfully,&nbsp;government agencies need to grant Freedom of Information requests, judges&nbsp;need to resist the temptation to approve the sealing of court documents too&nbsp;easily, and regulators need to resist the temptation to quickly settle enforcement&nbsp;actions without releasing a detailed investigatory report. If they do not, the law’s&nbsp;role as a source of media scrutiny diminishes, and, in turn, the effectiveness of&nbsp;reputational deterrence diminishes as well. A social planner should therefore&nbsp;take into consideration the information-production function of the law when&nbsp;evaluating the desirability of legal institutions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Specifically, we revisit the long-standing debate in the legal literature over how publicly available law enforcement records should be. The debate spans&nbsp;multiple applications: settlement versus trial, openness of proceedings, and so&nbsp;on. The reputational framework contributes to the debate along three key&nbsp;dimensions. First, it injects a real-life implications perspective into a too often&nbsp;abstracted debate. Second, it allows us to disentangle the normally comingled&nbsp;facets of the openness versus secrecy debate.<sup>4</sup> Law-as-source dynamics play out&nbsp;differently in questions such as whether to keep the amount of a settlement&nbsp;secret or whether to seal documents already submitted to the court. Finally, the&nbsp;reputational perspective provides a roadmap for concrete steps that can facilitate&nbsp;more law-as-source benefits. One way to mitigate the existing failure-to-warn&nbsp;problem without overburdening courts is to install an information safety valve:&nbsp;pre-specify criteria under which the filing of additional disputes would trigger a&nbsp;mechanism that makes information about previous disputes publicly available.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The timeliest and most critical issue that the reputational framework sheds light on is the proliferation of one-sided arbitration clauses that effectively waive&nbsp;class actions. The heated debate over this recent mandatory arbitration wave&nbsp;concentrates on justice and efficiency toward parties to the dispute: proponents&nbsp;argue that it will streamline dispute resolution and reduce lawyer fees, while&nbsp;opponents argue that it will hurt the already disadvantaged workers, consumers&nbsp;and suppliers, depriving them of their day in court. Yet, as </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 8</span><span class="font21"> shows, the&nbsp;existing debate too often misses the forest for the trees. Instead of analyzing&nbsp;fairness and efficiency toward parties to a given dispute, we should focus on&nbsp;effects on the market overall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The chapter specifically cautions from current proposals to adopt mandatory arbitration in corporate and securities law. Even if shifting from&nbsp;litigation to arbitration may be good for a specific company </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">and</span><span class="font21"> its investors, it&nbsp;may prove detrimental to the market overall. We will lose the positive&nbsp;externality (in the form of quality information on corporate behavior) that comes&nbsp;with litigation. A shift to mandatory arbitration may reduce the administrative&nbsp;costs of litigation, but hurt the ability of the market to discipline itself. In other&nbsp;words, mandatory arbitration provisions may reduce the effectiveness of&nbsp;reputational deterrence, and therefore be bad for investors as a group.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">A short </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Conclusion</span><span class="font21"> offers a recap of the overarching themes and sketches directions for potential extensions of the law-and-reputation framework.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Methodology</span></h4>
<p><span class="font21">A few words on methodology are in order from the outset. The reason legal scholars have understudied reputation is not because they find reputational&nbsp;incentives to be unimportant, but because scholars find them to be messy. The&nbsp;extant corporate governance literature, for example, deals extensively with&nbsp;“hard” market incentives such as executive compensation or the market for&nbsp;corporate control, which are easier to quantify, but it understudies “soft” market&nbsp;incentives such as maintaining a reputation for integrity. Reputational forces&nbsp;follow fuzzy dynamics and are hard to capture in neat models or direct statistical&nbsp;proofs.</span><span class="font16">5 </span><span class="font21">My strategy in addressing the gap and fleshing out the important yet&nbsp;understudied reputational forces was therefore to triangulate, examining them&nbsp;from multiple theoretical and empirical angles. The idea behind triangulation is&nbsp;that combining multiple theoretical and empirical materials can minimize the&nbsp;biases of any single theory/method. Triangulation is especially fitting when&nbsp;dealing with messy factors with little existing hard data, as in our case. It&nbsp;bolsters the prima facie plausibility of the argument.</span><span class="font16">6</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">I start every inquiry by synthesizing theoretical insights from multiple disciplines (as any theory about reputation should).<sup>7</sup> The process of reputational&nbsp;judgment involves issues of belief revision, diffusion of information, economic&nbsp;incentives, and feedback. I therefore combine insights from information&nbsp;economics with insights from social psychology, communication science, and&nbsp;management. For example, I delve into attribution and impression formation&nbsp;theories, to understand how stakeholders make sense of good/bad news and&nbsp;change their attitudes accordingly.</span><span class="font16">8</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Existing statistical data can serve as a check, highlighting my theoretical insights’ strengths and limitations. In </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 5</span><span class="font21">, for example, I show why a&nbsp;signaling explanation is better than a goodwill explanation in accounting for the&nbsp;fact that most corporate philanthropy expenditures are in cash, or that the high-tech and pharmaceutical industries are the biggest donors. In </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 2</span><span class="font21">, I use&nbsp;large-</span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span class="font21">' studies of stock market reactions to litigation to identify the set of cases&nbsp;in which my reputational theory applies. Most notably, the fact that the size of&nbsp;the legal sanction is not correlated with reputational sanctions, and that legal&nbsp;disputes that culminate in verdicts are better for shareholder value than disputes&nbsp;that culminate in settlements, illustrate the need to rethink common assumptions&nbsp;and adopt a more nuanced reputational theory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The core arguments in this book rest on my independent empirical work, which follows a mixed-methods approach. I emphasize three methodologies in&nbsp;particular: interviews, case studies, and content analysis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Each line of inquiry in this book contains insights from conducting in-depth open conversational interviews with practitioners.</span><span class="font16">9 </span><span class="font21">The iterative process of&nbsp;picking practitioners’ brains about holes in existing theories and then going back&nbsp;to the drawing board generated some interesting insights. For example, I revised&nbsp;the book’s core thesis when practically all the interviewees (litigators, crisis&nbsp;management consultants, and journalists) kept raising the same theme: the&nbsp;information flow from the courtroom to the court of public opinion is badly&nbsp;distorted. In other words, they made me rethink my initial theory: even if the&nbsp;legal system does manage to produce accurate reputation information internally,&nbsp;such information does not necessarily reach stakeholders and affect their beliefs.&nbsp;This insight redirected my attention and I began searching for patterns of&nbsp;distortions in information flows using other methodologies, such as conducting&nbsp;content analysis of media coverage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Another qualitative method that this book frequently invokes is case studies. My mode of case-studies research is “constructivist”: I use specific cases&nbsp;to illustrate, shed light, and serve as a check on competing theoretical&nbsp;frameworks.— To these ends, I employ several “purposive” selection criteria.&nbsp;The corporate law chapter, for example, rests on a famous court case that&nbsp;involves the Disney company as a “crucial, ‘most likely’ case”:<sup>11</sup> the Disney&nbsp;case is widely considered the paradigmatic example of an existing theory of how&nbsp;corporate law works. By digging deep into the case I showed how even such a&nbsp;supposedly clear-cut case does not follow the theory’s predictions. The case&nbsp;study therefore illustrates the problems in the hegemonic theory and opens up&nbsp;space for my alternative framework. Another case that appears throughout the&nbsp;book, for purposes of highlighting problems with existing theories of deterrence,&nbsp;is that of DuPont. In the process of manufacturing Teflon, DuPont emitted into&nbsp;the environment an extremely harmful chemical. The justification for using&nbsp;DuPont as a case study comes from the richness of detail: twenty years of&nbsp;litigation against DuPont’ s toxic pollution have unearthed a trove of thousands&nbsp;of internal documents, which give us a rare peek into a large company’s&nbsp;decision-making processes. This rare peek is especially valuable when you&nbsp;consider questions of deterrence. Deterrence, after all, is a perceptual process: it&nbsp;is not about the magnitude of sanctions or likelihood of detection per se, but&nbsp;rather about how the intended audience </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">perceives</span><span class="font21"> the sanctions and likelihood of&nbsp;detection. By reading though the intracompany emails or internal meeting notes,&nbsp;we learn some valuable, disturbing lessons about how companies manage to&nbsp;manipulate public opinion and dilute expected legal and reputational sanctions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Finally and perhaps most importantly, the arguments throughout the book rely heavily on content analysis. </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 2</span><span class="font21"> presents findings from a “law as&nbsp;source” project, where I coded prizewinning investigative projects from the&nbsp;1995-2015 period. Specifically, I coded the extent to which these exemplary&nbsp;cases of accountability journalism relied upon legal sources, and found that in&nbsp;over half of them the legal sources played a “but for” role. The content analysis&nbsp;therefore gives us a sense of the magnitude of the law’s reputational effects, as&nbsp;well as insights into the cross-sectional variation: the areas in which law-as-source dynamics are more or less pronounced. The securities regulation chapter&nbsp;compares the content of the SEC enforcement announcements to preexisting&nbsp;media coverage of the same misbehavior-in-question, to show that the SEC&nbsp;produces mostly stale information. The corporate law chapter examines how&nbsp;newspaper coverage of big corporate debacles changes before, during, and after&nbsp;litigation. The analysis suggests that the dynamics of litigation’s reputational&nbsp;impact follow counterintuitive patterns: the process of litigation (pleading,&nbsp;discovery, and trial) is more damaging to companies’ reputations than verdicts,&nbsp;judicial scolding is not necessarily hurting companies’ reputations, and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">I also draw occasionally from my </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">practical</span><span class="font21"> experience with reputation consulting, especially at the Reputation Institute. This practical experience&nbsp;provided me not just with an opportunity to hone my theory, but also with access&nbsp;to proprietary databases and methodologies on how to measure reputation. The&nbsp;usual caveat applies: the views presented here are my own, and do not represent&nbsp;those of the organizations I worked with on these issues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">I view the fact that my methodology is more qualitative and exploratory in nature not as a bug, but rather as a feature of this book. Qualitative, exploratory&nbsp;elements are necessary given the subject matter and the state of the art. When the&nbsp;phenomenon in question - here, interactions between law and reputation - has&nbsp;received little previous empirical and theoretical attention, more qualitative and&nbsp;exploratory work is especially productive, given the need to stir ideas and&nbsp;develop new hypotheses. Furthermore, because this book does not focus on the&nbsp;average effect of law enforcement on reputation, but rather on the variation and&nbsp;the processes that connect legal enforcement to reputation, it makes more sense</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">to adopt qualitative methods that shed light on the mechanisms that tie causes to effects.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Scope</span></h4>
<p><span class="font21">To delineate the scope of inquiry, it is useful to situate </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Law and Reputation </span><span class="font21">within three related literatures: law and social norms, corporate governance, and&nbsp;reputation (at the intersection of economics and management).</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">At the most basic level, </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Law and Reputation</span><span class="font21"> fits within a larger literature that deals with interactions between legal and nonlegal systems of control, often&nbsp;grouped together under the “law and social norms” moniker.— Adverse actions&nbsp;may trigger three kinds of nonlegal sanctions. When the violator suffers shaming&nbsp;- the opprobrium of others - the sanction is an external moral sanction. When&nbsp;the violator suffers from her own guilty feelings, the sanction is an internal&nbsp;moral sanction. When the violator suffers from diminished business&nbsp;opportunities in the future, the sanction is reputational.— Among the scholars&nbsp;who acknowledge that legal and nonlegal systems interact, there is a tendency to&nbsp;focus more on interactions between law and morals. By contrast, we focus on the&nbsp;oft-ignored interactions between law and reputation.<sup>14</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Law and Reputation</span><span class="font21"> therefore emphasizes a </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">belief-shaping role of the law, </span><span class="font21">while most of the extant literature emphasizes </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">a preference-shaping role.<sup>15&nbsp;</sup></span><span class="font21">Under the prevalent approach the law affects morals by pronouncing the right&nbsp;way to behave, thus inducing social shaming of or guilty feelings in those who&nbsp;misbehave.<sup>16</sup> I agree with the premise that the law affects behavior not just by&nbsp;what it does (sanctions) but also by what it says. But I argue that the law tells us&nbsp;not just what the norms are or ought to be, but also whether the norms were&nbsp;violated in specific instances. To be sure, my emphasis on the informational role&nbsp;of the law does not exclude the possibility of the finger-wagging role of the law.&nbsp;The relative strength of each role depends on the context. I conjecture that my&nbsp;theory is more relevant in environments with diffused and atomistic participants&nbsp;and super-strong economic incentives (think publicly traded companies), where&nbsp;it makes sense to highlight reputational rather than moral sanctions.<sup>17</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Within the accounts that focus on reputation, most focus on close-knit communities with repeated interactions, such as the cotton industry or diamond&nbsp;merchants.<sup>18</sup> I, by contrast, focus on contexts where reputation information&nbsp;travels via intermediaries, relying on technology to reach larger, loose-knit&nbsp;communities. Accordingly, I do not deal with the traditional problems of&nbsp;reputation information, such as local distribution and impermanence, but rather&nbsp;with understudied problems, such as how to make sense of an abundance of&nbsp;ambiguous information, or which intermediary to trust, and corporate reputation&nbsp;rather than individual reputation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The book’s focus on corporate behavior connects it to the corporate governance literature. Corporate governance scholars refer to&nbsp;market/reputational solutions frequently. Yet the focus on agency theory has&nbsp;steered scholars away from grappling with one important precondition of market&nbsp;solutions: the accuracy of market players’ beliefs. Pertinently, the corporate&nbsp;governance literature has dealt extensively with the relationship between the&nbsp;board of directors and shareholders, to the point where it neglects the role of&nbsp;other key intermediaries.<sup>19</sup> </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Law and Reputation,</span><span class="font21"> by contrast, focuses on the&nbsp;understudied corporate governance </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">role of the media.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Finally, the book relates to, and draws heavily from, a fast-emerging reputation literature, which has largely escaped legal scholars.<sup>21</sup> My scope of&nbsp;inquiry here differs from the reputation literature along several key dimensions.&nbsp;For one, much of the practitioner-oriented reputation literature deals with&nbsp;reputational rewards, that is, how companies can develop a good reputation. I&nbsp;focus rather on reputational sanctions. Relatedly, the extant literature has&nbsp;historically focused on how firms’ actions shape their reputation in their&nbsp;stakeholders’ minds.<sup>22</sup> I, by contrast, focus on the other side of the equation,&nbsp;namely, on those who dispense reputational sanctions (stakeholders), or facilitate&nbsp;reputational sanctions (information intermediaries and, in particular, mass&nbsp;media).<sup>23</sup> Most importantly, the extant literature ignores the role that the law&nbsp;plays in dictating reputation. Focusing on how the legal system shapes media&nbsp;coverage and stakeholders’ perceptions provides answers to the key question of&nbsp;why similar behaviors lead to different reputational outcomes.<sup>24</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">***</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">“Reputation matters” has become a mantra in the legal literature. Legal scholars increasingly refer to reputational concerns as important forces that shape our&nbsp;behavior across a wide range of phenomena: from corporate governance and the&nbsp;recent financial crisis to state compliance with international obligations.<sup>25&nbsp;</sup>Mounting empirical evidence shows just how real reputational sanctions can be:&nbsp;news about corporate misbehavior often brings with it declines in stock prices, in&nbsp;consumer willingness to pay, and in employee motivation.<sup>26</sup> Yet so far the&nbsp;literature has stayed remarkably silent on exactly </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">how</span><span class="font21"> reputation matters, or how&nbsp;reputation interacts with the law. This book explores these two questions in&nbsp;depth. The upshot is that to understand how reputation matters, you need to&nbsp;understand how the law affects reputation, and vice versa.</span></p>

My approach can be distinguished from these accounts by&nbsp;the answers to two key questions: what gap in market knowledge is the legal&nbsp;system filling, and how is it filling it? First, other accounts usually assume&nbsp;that market players are not aware of corporate misconduct, and therefore&nbsp;conclude that the role of the legal system is to draw attention to previously&nbsp;unnoticed corporate shenanigans. </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">See also </span><span class="font15" style="font-variant:small-caps;">j o n at h a n r . m a c e y, t h e d e at h o f&nbsp;c o r p o r at e r e p u tat i o n 1 2 </span><span class="font21">(2013).

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Theory</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">How Reputation Works</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark261"></a>1.1 Introduction</span></h4>
<p><span class="font21">Reputation matters. Companies invest vast resources in building and maintaining a good reputation. And the threat of losing reputation once bad news about the&nbsp;company breaks disciplines corporate behavior to begin with. Companies&nbsp;anticipate that the release of damning information about them may raise the costs&nbsp;of financing, because investors and lenders now realize that the company has&nbsp;poorer internal controls than they had previously thought. Or it may raise the&nbsp;operational costs of the company, because consumers, suppliers, and employees&nbsp;now perceive the company’s operational culture to be more opportunistic than&nbsp;they had initially assumed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Mounting empirical evidence shows just how real the reputational consequences of corporate misbehavior can be.<sup>1</sup> Event studies, which examine&nbsp;the stock market reaction upon revelation of bad news, show that when publicly&nbsp;traded companies are caught cooking the books or violating securities&nbsp;regulations, the reputational sanction actually dwarfs the legal sanction (six&nbsp;times higher, at least).<sup>2</sup> Other studies show that institutional ownership declines&nbsp;significantly following a restatement, or that the market loses confidence in the&nbsp;firm’s earning announcements going forward.</span><span class="font16">3 </span><span class="font21">Similar dynamics are also in play&nbsp;with private companies. For example, venture capital companies that are&nbsp;involved in contractual disputes with entrepreneurs suffer heavy reputational&nbsp;damage: investors are less willing to invest in them and entrepreneurs are less&nbsp;willing to work with them going forward.</span><span class="font16">4 </span><span class="font21">Reputational sanctions are real not&nbsp;just at the company level, but also at the individual level. Directors whose&nbsp;companies are involved in corporate governance debacles lose directorship&nbsp;offers in other companies (their labor-market reputation takes a hit).<sup>5</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Legal scholars are seemingly well aware of the power of reputation. Commercial legal scholars, in particular, invoke it frequently, in analyses of&nbsp;consumer protection, financial markets, and so on.</span><span class="font16">6 </span><span class="font21">Yet legal scholars usually&nbsp;invoke reputation within the framework of conventional economic models. They&nbsp;treat the process of reputational sanctioning as a straightforward, binary process:&nbsp;as long as market players learn about misbehavior, they will punish the&nbsp;misbehaving entities by withholding future business opportunities.</span><span class="font16">7 </span><span class="font21">Under this&nbsp;simplistic approach, legal scholars </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">assume</span><span class="font21"> that reputational concerns shape&nbsp;behavior in a certain scenario, without fully explaining why this is so or&nbsp;examining the social costs of reputational sanctions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">This chapter shifts our approach from making assumptions on whether reputation matters to explaining how exactly reputation matters. By drawing on&nbsp;recent theoretical and empirical insights from the multidisciplinary reputation&nbsp;literature, I show that in reality reputational sanctioning is an inherently noisy&nbsp;process, with the potential to exact heavy social costs. Even when market players&nbsp;learn about certain misbehavior, they often lack the incentives and/or&nbsp;information to properly update their beliefs about the misbehaving company. As&nbsp;a result, the market systematically underreacts to certain types of misconduct and&nbsp;overreacts to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Section 1.2</span><span class="font21"> defines reputation, and explains what determines the magnitude of reputational sanctions: the degree to which stakeholders judge the bad news as&nbsp;indicative of the company’s future behavior. </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Section 1.3</span><span class="font21"> details the many biases&nbsp;that plague the process of stakeholder judgments. </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Section 1.4</span><span class="font21"> explains why the&nbsp;biases do not cancel out, and therefore lead to systematic market under- or&nbsp;overreactions.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark262"></a>1.2 How Reputational Sanctions Work</span></h4>
<p><span class="font21">A company’s reputation can be defined as the set of beliefs that stakeholders hold regarding the company’s quality.</span><span class="font16">8 </span><span class="font21">Without the ability to directly observe&nbsp;the company’s abilities and intentions, stakeholders rely on the company’s past&nbsp;observable actions as cues to evaluate how the company is likely to behave in&nbsp;the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">In that sense, a reputational sanction is the product of stakeholders updating beliefs and lowering expectations. Upon hearing bad news about the company,&nbsp;stakeholders infer that the company’s “type” is worse than they have realized.&nbsp;The company is now perceived as more likely to defect in the future, and so&nbsp;stakeholders reduce their willingness to interact with the company going&nbsp;forward. Investors hearing about a corporate governance scandal will start&nbsp;demanding higher returns for their investment, customers hearing about a&nbsp;product recall will purchase fewer products, and so forth.</span><span class="font16">9 </span><span class="font21">The aggregate of&nbsp;diminished business opportunities constitutes the reputational sanction for&nbsp;violating market norms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">So far, the story seems straightforward: if a company misbehaves, it risks losing future business opportunities. But a much more interesting question&nbsp;remains understudied: how exactly do stakeholders update their beliefs? How&nbsp;many business opportunities will the company lose for a given misconduct?&nbsp;After all, we know from everyday experience that </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">not all bad news is created&nbsp;equal.</span><span class="font21"> Similar adverse actions cause different reputational outcomes. One&nbsp;financial company weathers fraud allegations relatively unscathed, while another&nbsp;goes bankrupt. One top executive takes the fall when her company misbehaves&nbsp;while another is unaffected. So what explains the variation in market reaction?</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The legal literature tends to boil the answer down to one factor: do stakeholders have information about the behavior in question or not. But&nbsp;</span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">information does not automatically translate into reputational damages.</span><span class="font21"> The fact&nbsp;that bad news broke - that an allegation of corporate misconduct became public&nbsp;- is a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition for meaningful reputational&nbsp;damage to occur. Several additional conditions have to hold: </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">diffusion,&nbsp;certification,</span><span class="font21"> and </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">attribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Damning information has to be widely diffused so that it reaches a critical mass of stakeholders in order for the reputational sanction to be meaningful.<sup>10&nbsp;</sup>Information that was widely diffused has to be certified as credible for the&nbsp;company’s stakeholders to consider it seriously. After all, stakeholders do not&nbsp;change what they think about the company based on any piece of information&nbsp;spread by a fly-by-night rumor propagator. And even information that was&nbsp;diffused and certified has to first be attributed to deep-seated flaws that are likely&nbsp;to reoccur in the future, in order for the company’s stakeholders to update their&nbsp;beliefs and act on it.<sup>11</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Notably, the magnitude of reputational sanctions depends largely on how stakeholders perceive the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">indicativeness of future behavior.<sup>12</sup></span><span class="font21"> Reputation&nbsp;sanctioning rests on the “how is it relevant to me” question. That is, stakeholders&nbsp;finding out about a corporate misconduct try to infer how this specific event is&nbsp;indicative of their own future interactions with the company. Some pieces of bad&nbsp;news are deemed more relevant than others. To generalize: when stakeholders&nbsp;attribute the bad news to a one-off mistake, such as a rogue low-level employee&nbsp;who was subsequently fired, the reputational sanction is likely to be small. By&nbsp;contrast, when stakeholders attribute the bad news to a deep-seated flaw, such as&nbsp;a total breakdown of internal checks and balances throughout the corporate&nbsp;hierarchy, the reputational sanction is likely to be large. After all, no one wants&nbsp;to work for, buy from, or invest in companies with deep-rooted problems that&nbsp;will likely resurface.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">To illustrate, consider an empirical study of stock market reactions to airplane crashes.<sup>13</sup> The study finds that not all news of crashes is created equal.&nbsp;The stock price reacts differently based on how the media covers the crash.&nbsp;When the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Wall Street Journal</span><span class="font21"> attributes the crash to internal causes, such as&nbsp;maintenance problems, the stock prices decline dramatically. By contrast, when&nbsp;the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Journal</span><span class="font21"> reports that the crash was caused by external conditions, such as&nbsp;unanticipated weather conditions or a mistake by the ground crew at the airport,&nbsp;the market does not react negatively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">This intuitive point is worth reiterating, as it has largely escaped the legal literature: bad news does not automatically translate into reputational sanctions.&nbsp;For one, certain types of bad news carry zero reputational repercussions.&nbsp;Empirical studies of stock market reactions show that when companies are&nbsp;caught polluting the environment or bribing officials in developing countries&nbsp;(misbehavior against unspecified third parties), there is little to no reputational&nbsp;harm.<sup>14</sup> More pertinently, even for misbehaviors that do carry reputational&nbsp;repercussions (misbehavior against trade partners, as in breaching contracts), the&nbsp;magnitude of the sanction varies greatly as a function of the public perception of&nbsp;what caused the debacle. When stakeholders read bad news, they try to infer the&nbsp;degree of intentionality and controllability involved in the misconduct.— The&nbsp;more stakeholders perceive the reported misbehavior as intentional and&nbsp;controllable, the more they will update downward their evaluation of the&nbsp;company - a bigger reputational sanction.<sup>16</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The upshot is that the process of translating bad news into reputational assessments requires </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">not just facts about what happened but also interpretations&nbsp;and judgments of how things happened.</span><span class="font21"> And the next crucial step is to&nbsp;acknowledge that the facts are often open to multiple interpretations and market&nbsp;players often get the interpretation wrong. Unlike in the airplane crashes&nbsp;scenario, where it is relatively easy to attribute the right cause to the problem, in&nbsp;other contexts there is no black box. Stakeholders often interpret an isolated&nbsp;mistake as a deep-seated flaw and vice versa. There is often a gap between&nbsp;outsiders’ perceptions and the reality of how things happened. To better&nbsp;understand reputational sanctions, we therefore need to delve into the sources&nbsp;that bridge gaps between perception and reality.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark263"></a>1.3 Why Reputational Sanctions Are Noisy</span></h4>
<p><span class="font21">Several conditions have to apply in order for a misbehaving company to suffer meaningful reputational damage. Information about the misbehavior has to&nbsp;become public (revelation); reach a critical mass of stakeholders (diffusion); be&nbsp;considered as credible (certification), and indicative of the company’s future&nbsp;behavior (attribution); and stakeholders have to be motivated to act on it -punishing the company by taking their business elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Yet none of these conditions is automatic. The process of reputational sanctioning is systematically distorted due to issues with asymmetric&nbsp;information, judgment biases, and divergent incentives. To appreciate just how&nbsp;noisy reputational assessments are, it is useful to break down the process of&nbsp;reputational sanctioning into its different components.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark264"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark265"></a>1.3.1 Players Who Dispense Sanctions (Stakeholders)</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">Unlike legal sanctions, reputational sanctions are not dispensed by public officials, but rather by the company stakeholders themselves. The stakeholders&nbsp;who reduce their interactions with misbehaving companies have the right&nbsp;incentives: they stand to gain from accurately judging how things happened and&nbsp;from staying away from bad companies. However, stakeholders often lack the&nbsp;right information. In some cases, stakeholders will not even be aware of the&nbsp;misbehavior. When chemical giant DuPont emitted an opaque toxic chemical&nbsp;dubbed C8 into the air while producing Teflon without notifying the public or&nbsp;regulators, it took the outside world decades to find out about it.<sup>17</sup> The&nbsp;asymmetries in information between the company’s insiders and outsiders can be&nbsp;extreme.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Even in instances when outsiders know with some certainty </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">what</span><span class="font21"> happened - that a company granted a big bonus for a failed CEO, or that a certain amount&nbsp;of people were harmed by an auto tire defect - they find it hard to understand&nbsp;</span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">how</span><span class="font21"> things happened. It is especially hard for outsiders to know the inner&nbsp;workings of the company. In other words, stakeholders are not well informed&nbsp;about questions such as what top managers knew, when they knew it, and could&nbsp;they have stopped it. As Oliver Williamson put it, we often lack the “second-level information”: we observe the bad outcomes but are unaware of the&nbsp;circumstances that led to them.<sup>18</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Furthermore, even when stakeholders have information, they process it imperfectly, for various reasons. Judgment biases sway our reputational&nbsp;assessments.<sup>19</sup> For example, we tend to overly focus on issues that can be easily&nbsp;summoned into our memory (availability bias).— In other words, we evaluate the&nbsp;likelihood that a certain behavior will reoccur according to our ability to&nbsp;remember examples of it: vividness is an important determinant of reputational&nbsp;sanctions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">To illustrate, consider the difference in public reaction to two Carnival Cruise Line incidents. In 2012, CarnivaTs ship ran aground, in a calm sea with&nbsp;good visibility. The captain inexplicably delayed the order to abandon ship, and&nbsp;the evacuation took many hours to complete (in violation of maritime laws),&nbsp;culminating in the death of over thirty people. Then, a year later, another of&nbsp;CarnivaTs ship suffered an engine fire and subsequently lost power during a&nbsp;cruise. This time around, the staff reaction was swift and proper: they&nbsp;extinguished the fire, restored most critical systems, and immediately contacted&nbsp;the coast guard to receive supplies. The company then offered a public apology,&nbsp;refunds, flights home, and credits for future cruises. The 2012 event is a&nbsp;textbook case for mishandling a crisis, while the 2013 event is the opposite. Yet&nbsp;the reputational damage (sales lost) was seemingly </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">worse</span><span class="font21"> following the 2013&nbsp;event. The media highlighted vivid images of raw sewage in hallways and on the&nbsp;walls, and nicknamed the ordeal as “the ship of poop” event. The image made&nbsp;the 2013 event more vivid, causing more consumers to book their cruises&nbsp;elsewhere than after the 2012 event.<sup>21</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Another relevant type of biases is </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">attribution errors.</span><span class="font21"> When stakeholders hear bad news about a company, they ask themselves why the company did that.&nbsp;By identifying the cause of behavior, we hope to gain knowledge of the&nbsp;company’s “stable traits and dispositions,” and be able to predict how it will&nbsp;behave in the future.<sup>22</sup> Yet attributions are notoriously messy.<sup>23</sup> For instance,&nbsp;when interpreting events stakeholders suffer from what psychologists call the&nbsp;“naive psychologist phenomenon.”<sup>24</sup> That is, we tend to adopt causal rather than&nbsp;contextual explanations: we assume that if something bad happened, then the&nbsp;company and businesspersons involved are bad.<sup>25</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">In all, all too frequently stakeholders either lack proper information, or process whatever information they have improperly. As a result, stakeholders&nbsp;often fail to calibrate reputational sanctions accurately: they underreact to some&nbsp;misbehaviors while overreacting to others.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark266"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark267"></a>1.3.2 Players Who Facilitate Sanctions (Information Intermediaries)</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">Another basic problem with reputational sanctions stems from the narrow incentives of those who provide information and interpretations on corporate&nbsp;misbehavior. Reputational sanctions in today’s world are largely determined by&nbsp;“information intermediaries.” Back when most of our interactions happened&nbsp;within close-knit communities, we formed impressions of businesses based&nbsp;mostly on our direct experience with the seller (first party) or gossip we heard&nbsp;from our close peers (second party). Yet, in today’s world, we often form&nbsp;impressions of companies based on what we gather from third parties: mass&nbsp;media, stock analysts, institutional investors, and corporate watchdogs.— The&nbsp;way that these intermediaries screen, frame, certify, and diffuse information&nbsp;dictates the effectiveness of reputational deterrence. The intermediaries often&nbsp;possess more information and expertise than the average stakeholder. However,&nbsp;intermediaries have their own narrow incentives to push the market toward&nbsp;overreacting to some behaviors and underreacting to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">For large companies in particular, reputation is largely a function of media coverage.— Yet the media has difficulties scrutinizing corporate behavior, due to&nbsp;a plethora of factors. For example, the media suffers from dependence on&nbsp;advertisers.— A profit-minded media firm will think twice before producing&nbsp;biting watchdog-type reporting on big advertisers, so as not to risk losing much-needed advertising revenues.— Similarly, the media depends on sources.— To&nbsp;bring stories about the inner workings of large businesses, journalists frequently&nbsp;rely on insiders. Yet these insiders have little incentives to provide damning&nbsp;information about breakdowns in their own companies. And for the journalist,&nbsp;producing watchdog-type reporting on those who are your main sources is akin&nbsp;to burning a bridge.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Other factors include journalists’ own shortcomings,— or their need to cater to their audiences’ biases.<sup>33</sup> Indeed, one study found that the financial media&nbsp;criticizes executive stock-option plans based on high value at the exercising date&nbsp;(which is a function of external conditions) rather than at the granting date&nbsp;(which is more related to the strength of corporate governance).<sup>34</sup> Another study&nbsp;found that the media criticizes shady accounting practices based on the visibility&nbsp;of companies rather than the size of the discrepancy: large, well-known&nbsp;companies get more negative coverage for more minor deviations.— Such&nbsp;studies corroborate our notion that the media targets companies based not on the&nbsp;social harm done, but rather on spurious factors such as the visibility of and&nbsp;resentment toward these companies, or the entertainment value of the story.<sup>36</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Because of all these compromising factors, too often relevant information on corporate misbehavior is not spotlighted and diffused. Similar dynamics are&nbsp;in play with other information intermediaries. As a corporate-watchdog NGO, it&nbsp;pays to publish exaggerated criticisms against the McDonald’s-es of the world.&nbsp;After all, eliciting a strong market reaction against visible companies will help&nbsp;you win the competition for donors’ money and volunteers’ time. And stock&nbsp;market analysts have their own well-documented conflicts when reporting about&nbsp;companies.<sup>37</sup></span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark268"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark269"></a>1.3.3 Players Who Suffer Sanctions (Companies)</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">To debunk yet another simplifying assumption: reputational sanctions are not a one-sided event. Companies do not go down without a fight. Much like legal&nbsp;control, reputational control is a function of ongoing interactions between&nbsp;regulators and regulated players.<sup>38</sup> Corporate insiders invest billions in an&nbsp;attempt to hijack the information flow and influence how their adverse actions&nbsp;are being interpreted by the market.<sup>39</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Companies can dilute reputational sanctions through two channels: (1) avoiding detection, and (2) avoiding enforcement. To borrow crisis&nbsp;communication experts’ lingo, this is the “managing information,” and&nbsp;“managing meaning” channels, respectively.— “Managing information” denotes&nbsp;hiding your misconduct, or at least delaying the revelation of any damning&nbsp;information about you. Consider for example the documented pattern of&nbsp;camouflaging executive pay.<sup>41</sup> Corporate managers anticipate that if news&nbsp;breaks about their inflated pay, it will cause an outrage among stakeholders. In&nbsp;anticipation of the outrage, corporate insiders often manipulate outsiders’&nbsp;perceptions by changing how the pay package looks. By choosing to give the&nbsp;CEO an extra-undeserved $10 million through complex and opaque stock option&nbsp;plans, insiders may prevent an outrage that would have occurred if the CEO had&nbsp;received a less costly but more visible $5 million in cash. To revisit our&nbsp;DuPont-C8 example, there the company’s in-house lawyer was conducting&nbsp;internal workshops on what </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font21"> to document, to reduce the chances that any&nbsp;damning information would leak out.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">When their “managing information” efforts fail and bad news nevertheless leaks, companies can still resort to “managing meaning:” changing the way that&nbsp;market players interpret the information. Consider for example companies’&nbsp;investment in corporate social responsibility (CSR) as an image buffer.&nbsp;Stakeholders are less likely to attribute bad intentions to a perceivably nice&nbsp;company, chalking up the bad news to a one-off mistake rather than a deep-seated flaw.</span><span class="font16">43 </span><span class="font21">When the nice-guy buffer works effectively, the company&nbsp;mitigates the risk of reputational sanctions. Enron serves as a case in point:&nbsp;</span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 5</span><span class="font21"> discusses one of the least-covered aspects of the heavily covered&nbsp;debacle, namely, that Enron was considered the poster child for CSR before its&nbsp;collapse. Some scholars believe that the accolades showered upon Enron for its&nbsp;CSR image contributed to the slow detection and punishment of Enron’s&nbsp;misbehavior.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Companies can affect not only the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">revelation</span><span class="font21"> (hiding misconduct) and </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">attribution</span><span class="font21"> conditions, but also </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">certification.</span><span class="font21"> A well-developed psychology&nbsp;literature tells us that not all sources of information are created equal:&nbsp;stakeholders are more likely to update their beliefs and act on information when&nbsp;they perceive the source as credible.<sup>44</sup> Companies are well aware of these&nbsp;source-credibility effects, and invest resources trying to discredit any source of&nbsp;damning information about them. The classic example here is the tobacco&nbsp;industry’s fight against the evidence on second-hand smoking. An emerging&nbsp;literature now documents more generally how large companies are adept at&nbsp;“manufacturing doubt” on sound scientific evidence.<sup>45</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">And, as </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Section 1.3.2</span><span class="font21"> alluded to, companies can also limit the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">diffusion</span><span class="font21"> of damning information about them by capturing the media, as in threatening to sue&nbsp;in libel or to withhold advertising dollars and information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Agency problems within companies further dilute the reputational deterrence. Sometimes bad news that affects the company’s reputation may not&nbsp;affect the company’s decision-makers’ reputations. For example, one factor that&nbsp;drives a wedge between organizational-level and individual-level reputation is&nbsp;the time lag. When company decision-makers anticipate a big delay between the&nbsp;time they make a decision and the time in which information about their decision&nbsp;reaches the outside world, they may completely discount the threat of&nbsp;reputational sanctions. The executives’ labor-market reputation has an expiration&nbsp;date: reputational concerns only deter them to the extent that the executives&nbsp;expect to be still in the market by the time bad news breaks. Here as well, the&nbsp;DuPont debacle serves as a case in point. DuPont’s executives took the critical&nbsp;decision to continue emitting C8 without investing in abatement in 1984. Yet it&nbsp;was not until 2003 that mainline media started seriously scrutinizing the C8&nbsp;debacle. By then, out of the twenty-nine directors sitting on DuPont’s board back&nbsp;in 1984, nineteen had already died or retired from any other professional&nbsp;activity. Labor-market reputation had therefore stopped being a concern for&nbsp;them.<sup>46</sup> Under such scenarios, market discipline loses its force.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">*</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">As reputation scholar Mike Barnett points out, stakeholders are the agents of reputation control, yet these agents are very limited in their ability to patrol&nbsp;(notice), perceive (assess), and punish corporate misconduct.<sup>47</sup> Stakeholders&nbsp;either have limited access to information, or limited attention to deal with the&nbsp;information overload we face nowadays. Part of the reason that stakeholders are&nbsp;so bad at noticing and assessing corporate misconduct is that they cannot&nbsp;consistently rely on the media to spotlight and diffuse information for them,&nbsp;while the misbehaving companies manage to hide critical pieces of information&nbsp;and instill doubt in existing damning information. Importantly, even when&nbsp;stakeholders do notice and properly assess misconduct - that is, even when all&nbsp;four conditions (revelation, diffusion, certification, attribution) are met -stakeholders may still opt to not act on the information. When stakeholders&nbsp;perceive their ability to affect change as limited, they are less likely to bother&nbsp;taking their business elsewhere.<sup>48</sup> A common scenario is that of market&nbsp;concentration: buyers cannot punish a seller by switching to a competitor, if said&nbsp;seller is the only game in town.</span><span class="font16">49 </span><span class="font21">When stakeholders have no outside option,&nbsp;reputational deterrence loses its effectiveness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Taken together, the emerging pieces of evidence suggest that reputational sanctions are much noisier than was previously assumed. The next necessary&nbsp;step is to examine why it matters that reputation is noisy: what are the social&nbsp;costs stemming from noisy reputational assessments?</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark270"></a>1.4 The Implications of Noisy Reputational&nbsp;Sanctions</span></h4>
<p><span class="font21">The evidence demonstrates that the market overreacts to some misbehaviors and underreacts to others. Stakeholders may stop doing business with perfectly fine&nbsp;companies, or they may ignore early warning signs and continue doing business&nbsp;with rotten companies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Polinsky and ShavelTs proposal to abolish product liability for widely sold products provides a good case for illustration.— In making the argument that the&nbsp;market already monitors and deters misbehavior (whereby we can eliminate&nbsp;litigation without losing much deterrence), Polinsky and Shavell use three&nbsp;motivating examples: Johnson &amp; Johnson’s cyanide-laced Tylenol, Audi’s self-accelerating cars, and Odwalla’s contaminated juice.<sup>51</sup> In all these famous crises,&nbsp;information indeed disseminated quickly when something bad happened to&nbsp;widely sold products. When people died because they took a Tylenol, drove an&nbsp;Audi, or drank an Odwalla apple juice, the media were all over the story,&nbsp;consumers stopped purchasing products, and the stock prices plummeted. But a&nbsp;closer look at these three examples reveals an important yet overlooked point:&nbsp;we cannot assume that reputational forces punished and deterred optimally. In&nbsp;fact, in all these cases the market badly misjudged what happened and how it&nbsp;happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The Tylenol poisonings and Audi’s self-accelerating cars are good examples of market </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">over</span><span class="font21">reaction. In the Tylenol case, Johnson &amp; Johnson&nbsp;initially suffered huge reputational damages for something that it did not do - it&nbsp;was a case of external product tampering that happened on the retailer level.<sup>52&nbsp;</sup>The madman who tampered with Johnson &amp; Johnson products could have&nbsp;tampered with other companies’ products. Audi was also initially punished for&nbsp;something it did not do.<sup>53</sup> As was later proven, the self-acceleration allegations&nbsp;were false. Audi’s cars did not accelerate by themselves; they accelerated&nbsp;because the accusers mistook the gas pedals for the brakes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Odwalla’s case is a perfect example of the flip side: the market </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">underreacted</span><span class="font21"> to Odwalla’s breakdowns in quality control.— Odwalla had a&nbsp;preexisting image of a do-gooder, a socially responsible company, and that&nbsp;image served as a reputational buffer of sorts. And so, when top management&nbsp;stated that they could not have anticipated the juice contamination, stakeholders&nbsp;were willing to buy the company’s version and interpret the event favorably.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">At their core, then, these three famous examples do not tell the tale of optimal reputational sanctioning. They rather tell the tale of distorted&nbsp;reputational sanctioning. We cannot assume that the market reaction to those&nbsp;crises incentivized companies to invest optimally in product safety. If anything,&nbsp;those market reactions only distorted incentives: companies will now invest too&nbsp;much in the safety of certain visible products (following Tylenol); invest less in&nbsp;safety in general because arbitrary allegations against you may erase your&nbsp;reputational capital (following Audi); or invest too much in erecting reputational&nbsp;buffers - focusing on image instead of real quality (following Odwalla).</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Importantly, the evidence suggests that the market </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">systematically</span><span class="font21"> overreacts to certain misbehaviors and underreacts to others. We cannot discard the noise in&nbsp;reputational sanctions as irrational mistakes that cancel each other out.&nbsp;Companies that care about their reputation face incentives to excessively avoid&nbsp;some worthy behaviors (reputational over-deterrence), and excessively engage in&nbsp;some bad behaviors (reputational under-deterrence). For example, the market&nbsp;tends to overreact to failures of well-known companies and vivid failures, and&nbsp;underreact to less visible companies and opaque, complex issues.<sup>55</sup> Another&nbsp;factor to consider is the type of harm done: the market is likely to underreact&nbsp;when the misbehavior causes multiple small harms or concealed harms, and&nbsp;overreact when the victims are easily identifiable.<sup>56</sup> Yet another determinant is&nbsp;the state of the overall economy. Evidence suggests that reputational sanctions&nbsp;follow a supra-cyclical pattern.— When the economy is down, the public is&nbsp;actively searching for villains, so news about corporate misconduct may attract&nbsp;more attention. As a result, the market may overreact. By contrast, when the&nbsp;economy is booming, stakeholders might be more likely to ignore early warning&nbsp;signs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">As a result, reputational forces may distort primary behavior and hurt allocative efficiency. Companies may pick projects based on their reputational&nbsp;value and not on their “real” value.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The point about potential market over-deterrence is worth emphasizing, as it, too, has largely escaped the legal literature. Existing analyses usually assume&nbsp;that the noise in reputational sanctions leads strictly to under-punishment: large&nbsp;companies enjoy mismatches of information and power versus market players,&nbsp;and so are likely to exploit the holes in reputation systems in their favor.<sup>58</sup> But&nbsp;while it is indeed intuitive to think that companies can camouflage failures, one&nbsp;cannot ignore the dynamics that are in play once their failures are revealed. As&nbsp;scholars in other disciplines have recognized, once bad news breaks, market&nbsp;arbiters face incentives to pile on criticisms. The media tends to favor negative&nbsp;news,<sup>59</sup> and stakeholders suffer from negativity bias as well: we perceive&nbsp;negative information as more diagnostic than positive information.— Further, the&nbsp;naive psychologist bias seems to be stronger for corporate behavior than for&nbsp;individual behavior: we tend to assume that big businesses can control whatever&nbsp;happens to them. As a result, stakeholders may overreact and unnecessarily&nbsp;sever ties with otherwise healthy companies.<sup>61</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">To be sure, more (empirical) work is needed to identify the conditions under which the market is under- or overreacting. Still, the basic point about&nbsp;markets for reputation stands: they are much more flawed than was previously&nbsp;acknowledged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">*</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">My point is not that the invisible hand of the market for reputation never works, but rather that it cannot be assumed to generate optimal deterrence consistently.&nbsp;To recast the example we opened the book with, Polinsky and Shavell&nbsp;anticipated the “market imperfections” rebuttals to their argument that&nbsp;reputational deterrence makes legal liability redundant. To accommodate this&nbsp;potential rebuttal, they limited their proposal to abolish product liability only to&nbsp;widely sold products. Their logic was that with widely sold product, there is&nbsp;bound to be ample information on product defects, and so the market for&nbsp;reputation functions well enough to deter misbehavior. Yet our deep dive into&nbsp;the reputation literature reveals the fallacies in logic. For one, we cannot assume&nbsp;that consumers will have access to quality information just because the product&nbsp;is widely sold: if the product causes opaque, latent and dispersed damages,&nbsp;information may not surface even when harm is inflicted upon many victims.&nbsp;More importantly, even if information does surface, information does not&nbsp;automatically translate into reputation. It has to be properly certified, attributed,&nbsp;and diffused - and as we saw here, these conditions are far from automatic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The lesson for legal scholars and policy makers is straightforward: recognizing an area of market behavior with strong reputational concerns only&nbsp;begins analysis. A full analysis requires identifying whether the reputational&nbsp;forces deter optimally or not. Accurate reputation information is in a sense a&nbsp;public good. It carries social benefits: warning market players of a specific&nbsp;wrongdoer, deterring future potential wrongdoers, and causing market players to&nbsp;switch to doing business with the worthier competitors of the wrongdoer.— And&nbsp;it comes with social costs, such as resources spent on certifying rumors or&nbsp;fighting back false allegations. The private players who engage in reputational&nbsp;sanctioning - rumor propagators, media channels, stakeholders - do not fully&nbsp;internalize the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">social</span><span class="font21"> costs and benefits. Private players, when left alone, lack the&nbsp;information and incentives to produce accurate reputational sanctions. How can&nbsp;reputation markets function, then?</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Part of the answer lies in the fact that in reality the market is rarely left alone. Adverse actions are interpreted and assessed not just by market arbiters,&nbsp;but also by legal arbiters. In the Tylenol, Audi, Odwalla, and many other famous&nbsp;cases, the legal system produced information that propelled market players to&nbsp;revise their initial reaction to the bad news. In order to get a full picture of&nbsp;reputation we therefore need to explore the different channels through which the&nbsp;law generates information and affects reputations.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">How the Legal System Affects Reputation</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark333"></a>2.1 Introduction</span></h4>
<p><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 1</span><span class="font21"> revolved around the question of why similar behaviors lead to different reputational outcomes. This chapter suggests that a large part of the&nbsp;answer is the legal system. When stakeholders hear about a good or bad deed&nbsp;done by a company, they update their beliefs about the company’s quality and&nbsp;consequently update their willingness to interact with the company. But this&nbsp;process of belief revision - the process of reputational rewarding/sanctioning -does not operate in a vacuum. The legal system generates new pieces of&nbsp;information on the behavior in question and adds saliency and credibility to&nbsp;existing information. Stakeholders can then rely on the information that was&nbsp;generated by the legal system to reassess their beliefs about the company. In&nbsp;other words, the law dictates the market reaction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Section 2.2</span><span class="font21"> breaks down the law’s reputational effects into two categories: where information comes from, and how the information shapes reputation. The&nbsp;first category concerns the distinction between legal institutions that are&nbsp;primarily geared to produce information, such as disclosure requirements, and&nbsp;legal institutions that produce information as a by-product. The second category&nbsp;concerns the distinction between breaking new information, and shaping the&nbsp;saliency, credibility, and framing of given pieces of information in stakeholders’&nbsp;minds. Throughout all these different conduits, the legal system produces a&nbsp;positive externality: quality information that facilitates effective reputational&nbsp;deterrence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Evaluating the magnitude of this informational positive externality is a daunting task, though. Deterrence is hard to measure, and reputation is an even&nbsp;fuzzier concept. To provide some sense of reputational deterrence, I resort to&nbsp;using a proxy: media coverage. A multidisciplinary literature documents the&nbsp;important role that media scrutiny plays in holding powerful players to account.&nbsp;Effective media scrutiny facilitates reputational control. I ask the prior question,&nbsp;namely, what determines the effectiveness of media scrutiny. </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Section 2.3&nbsp;</span><span class="font21">presents evidence from interviewing reporters, going over a reporters-only&nbsp;database of tip sheets, scouring course syllabi in journalism schools, and&nbsp;conducting content analysis of prizewinning journalistic projects. The&nbsp;triangulation of these methods suggests that litigation is a key source of&nbsp;impactful media coverage, and therefore a key part in well-functioning&nbsp;reputation markets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Section 2.4</span><span class="font21"> refines our theory by accommodating potential limitations. The legal system does not always manage to produce relevant information. And even&nbsp;when it does, information from the legal system cannot cure all the biases in&nbsp;reputational sanctioning. It can help consumers understand whether a given&nbsp;product defect is endemic or idiosyncratic, but it cannot improve their bounded&nbsp;attention span, or make the media cover opaque topics. The key is to remember&nbsp;that the legal system does not have to be perfect in order to facilitate a well-functioning market for reputation. All it takes is that the legal system’s flaws are&nbsp;imperfectly correlated with the market system’s flaws. In other words, the&nbsp;interactions between the two systems operate as a diversified portfolio,&nbsp;mitigating the risk of extreme under or overreactions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Section 2.5</span><span class="font21"> increases our resolution, by focusing on factors that determine the variation in reputational effects: some types of legal disputes generate a big&nbsp;effect on disputants’ reputations, while others do not affect reputations&nbsp;whatsoever; some disputes actually boost the reputation of the defendants, while&nbsp;others hurt them greatly.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark334"></a>2.2 The Basic Story</span></h4>
<p><span class="font21">The legal system affects reputation in various ways. This section breaks the different reputational effects down by asking two straightforward questions.&nbsp;First, </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">where</span><span class="font21"> the information is coming from - what type of legal institution&nbsp;produces it? Does it come from legal institutions that are primarily geared to&nbsp;produce information (“direct sources” - as in disclosure requirements), or does it&nbsp;come from legal institutions that produce information only as a by-product&nbsp;(“indirect sources” - as in litigation). Second, </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">how</span><span class="font21"> the information affects&nbsp;reputational assessments. Does the legal system break news - reveals new&nbsp;information that was not previously available (“first-opinion effects”) to the&nbsp;market, or does it shape the framing and saliency of preexisting pieces of&nbsp;information (“second-opinion effects”).</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark335"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark336"></a>2.2.1 Where Information Comes From</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">Various legal institutions are primarily geared to make information about the behavior of powerful players available to the public. An obvious example is the&nbsp;Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).<sup>1</sup> Congress explicitly envisioned FOIA as&nbsp;contributing to the ability of the public to hold government players to account.<sup>2&nbsp;</sup>Another classic example is mandatory disclosure requirements. Disclosure&nbsp;requirements incentivize corporate decision makers to publicly reveal&nbsp;information about their own misconduct. Yet another example is whistleblowing&nbsp;laws. Whistleblowing laws protect the whistleblower from retaliation by her&nbsp;employer, and in some areas even offer substantive monetary rewards for&nbsp;blowing the whistle.</span><span class="font16">3 </span><span class="font21">As a result, they incentivize employees to flush out&nbsp;information about the behavior of their employers.</span><span class="font16">4</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">When legal scholars write about the information-production effects of the law, they usually focus on these “direct” channels. But if you were to ask&nbsp;investigative reporters, they would tell you that there exist other, “indirect”&nbsp;channels through which the legal system produces information, and that these&nbsp;indirect channels are at least equally important.</span><span class="font16">5</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">On paper, FOIA and public records laws, disclosure requirements, and whistleblowing acts should combine to provide ample information for journalists&nbsp;to hold powerful players to account and for market players to decide with whom&nbsp;they want to keep doing business. Yet in reality, direct sourcing channels are&nbsp;severely lacking. The implementation of FOIA is dysfunctional, fraught with&nbsp;delays and denials.</span><span class="font16">6 </span><span class="font21">As a result, many journalists give up on using FOIA at the&nbsp;outset.</span><span class="font16">7 </span><span class="font21">While the government is bombarded with FOIA requests, journalists&nbsp;(not to mention regular citizens) make up only a tiny fraction of FOIA users.</span><span class="font16">8&nbsp;</span><span class="font21">Disclosure laws, similarly, look good on paper but suffer from enforcement&nbsp;issues.</span><span class="font16">9 </span><span class="font21">Pertinently, the useful information - damning information about&nbsp;powerful players - either eludes disclosure altogether or gets buried under an&nbsp;avalanche of useless information.<sup>10</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">A fundamental problem with direct sourcing channels is that they work well only when there are preexisting high levels of accountability in the system. A&nbsp;journalist submitting a FOIA request in an attempt to expose government&nbsp;misconduct has to hope that the same powerful players that broke substantive&nbsp;rules will somehow abide by the information-production rules, instead of&nbsp;ignoring, delaying, or watering them down.<sup>11</sup> Similarly, corporate decision&nbsp;makers who engage in shady practices also tend not to be fully transparent when&nbsp;revealing information in their company’s official documents. Put differently,&nbsp;transparency requirements cannot bypass asymmetries in power.<sup>12</sup> As long as&nbsp;those in power are the ones in charge of enforcing disclosure requirements, it&nbsp;will be hard to use disclosure requirements to hold them to account.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Fortunately, even when direct sources fail, indirect sources prevail. Law enforcement actions, in particular, produce quality information on the behavior&nbsp;of powerful players in society. When government agencies or business&nbsp;companies misbehave and harm someone, the victim may enlist the help of the&nbsp;legal system. A plaintiffs lawyer may file a lawsuit, or a regulator may initiate&nbsp;an investigation to examine whether the powerful entity broke some rules and&nbsp;needs to pay. In the process of determining whether to impose legal sanctions,&nbsp;the law enforcement action produces information on how the parties to the&nbsp;dispute behaved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Litigation, especially in the US system, provides strong monetary incentives, such as damages and lawyers’ fees, for harmed parties to expose&nbsp;misbehavior in court. These strong incentives increase the chance that&nbsp;information about the alleged misconduct will spread readily and credibly to the&nbsp;court of public opinion. And as soon as a dispute enters the legal system, the law&nbsp;vests powers in private litigants to probe and demand relevant Information from&nbsp;their rivals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The last point - about information-extracting powers - is worth emphasizing. While direct sourcing channels often rely on players </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">volunteering&nbsp;</span><span class="font21">information, indirect sourcing channels often rely on </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">forcing</span><span class="font21"> information out of&nbsp;them. This fundamental difference can make information extracted during&nbsp;litigation/regulatory investigation more conducive to market players trying to&nbsp;understand how companies behaved, relative to information selectively released&nbsp;by the companies themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">As a result, law enforcement actions are a key source of reputation-relevant information. The immediate upshot is that legal strategies to improve the&nbsp;information environment should focus not just on disclosure requirements, but&nbsp;also on issues such as protective orders, confidential settlements, or mandatory&nbsp;arbitration clauses, which limit the information flows from the courtroom. But&nbsp;before we jump ahead to policy implications (</span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapters 7</span><span class="font21"> and 8 are waiting&nbsp;patiently), let us first continue breaking down the “reputation through litigation”&nbsp;dynamics, this time according to the different conduits through which they&nbsp;operate: litigation affects reputations not just by revealing new information, but&nbsp;also by shaping the diffusion, certification, and attribution of existing&nbsp;information.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark337"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark338"></a>2.2.2 How Information Affects Reputations</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">We saw in </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 1</span><span class="font21"> that one basic problem of reputational control arises from the difficulties of detecting and reacting in real time to corporate misbehavior.&nbsp;Law enforcement helps in revealing new information on corporate misbehavior&nbsp;by offering a bounty: the prospect of getting damages and lawyers’ fees in&nbsp;litigation incentivizes victims to expose the misbehavior publicly, in court. Once&nbsp;an issue gets to court, the legal system vests fact-finding powers in private&nbsp;litigants to probe and demand relevant information from their rivals. These facts-generating powers were primarily designed to increase the accuracy of legal&nbsp;adjudication. But they also generate as a by-product information to which market&nbsp;arbiters previously could not have been privy. The classic example here is&nbsp;internal email communications exposed during the discovery stage, showing just&nbsp;how big the organizational cover-up was.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">In other words, law enforcement can serve to reduce the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">detection costs</span><span class="font21"> of reputation control systems: the costs of revealing misconduct. In such instances,&nbsp;the law sets a reputational sanction in motion, pushing market players to react to&nbsp;corporate misconduct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">In many other situations, however, market players hardly need pushing. Research suggests that market players often learn about misconduct by large&nbsp;public companies - and act upon it - long before a lawsuit is filed. One&nbsp;comprehensive study estimates that the filing of a lawsuit is responsible for&nbsp;breaking bad news in less than 7 percent of financial misconduct cases.<sup>13</sup> In the&nbsp;other 93 percent of the cases market players learn about misbehavior from&nbsp;various other sources, such as whistleblowers, investigative reporters, or&nbsp;financial reports. Still, even when the legal system’s reaction is lagged it may&nbsp;nevertheless affect the market, albeit in a different way: shaping the attribution,&nbsp;certification, and diffusion of existing information. In other words, litigation&nbsp;helps not only by revealing new information, but also by processing existing&nbsp;information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Consider first the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">attribution</span><span class="font21"> stage. Judicial opinions are good at fleshing out patterns of misbehavior, organizing large chunks of information, and making&nbsp;it all less complex for outside observers. In particular, judicial opinions often&nbsp;make it easier on market players to assess how intentional the actions in question&nbsp;were - an important determinant of reputational sanctions. Think, for example,&nbsp;about securities litigation, where the judge has to make inferences about </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">scienter&nbsp;</span><span class="font21">from the outset. Such reputational impact is not limited to the (rare) disputes that&nbsp;culminate in a judicial verdict. Even in cases that settle early, legal documents&nbsp;that come out during pleading, discovery, or trial help not just by drawing&nbsp;outside observers’ attention to a misbehavior they were not aware of, but also by&nbsp;adding detail and analysis on how things happened. To reuse Oliver&nbsp;Williamson’s typology, litigation often provides stakeholders with the “second-level information” they too often miss (the context).</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">To illustrate, consider two of the most famous car company debacles: Ford Pinto’s defective fuel system design that led to explosions, and GM’s ignition&nbsp;switch recalls. Reputation scholars have wondered why Ford received such a big&nbsp;reputational hit following the Pinto scandal, while other car companies who&nbsp;suffered similar problems did not.<sup>14</sup> The answer comes from litigation.&nbsp;Discovery surfaced an internal company memo, showing that the company&nbsp;</span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">knowingly</span><span class="font21"> opted to not recall or fix Pinto models even though they knew these&nbsp;models had safety issues (specifically, a fuel tank being prone to combust in&nbsp;rear-end collisions). Similarly, the key moment that changed public perception&nbsp;of the GM scandal came when the media spotlighted a deposition given by a&nbsp;company’s engineer, suggesting that GM knew about the faulty switches but&nbsp;took a “business decision” not to replace them.<sup>15</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Litigation also affects reputation through </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">certification.</span><span class="font21"> We saw in </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 1 </span><span class="font21">that damning information too often does not result in reputational damages,&nbsp;because stakeholders discount it as not credible. But information coming from&nbsp;the legal system is considered relatively credible, and thereby tends to move the&nbsp;needle. Judicial opinions are normally considered disinterested and fair. In the&nbsp;corporate governance context, for example, the business community considers&nbsp;Delaware judges to be reputable experts, and attaches considerable weight to any&nbsp;opinion they have about companies and businesspersons.<sup>16</sup> Depositions and&nbsp;testimonies are given under oath. Documents are produced under the threat of&nbsp;perjury. Indeed, several journalists I interviewed told me that the mere phrase&nbsp;“according to court documents” is a rhetorical device they use to increase their&nbsp;story’s credibility.— A journalist may have all the information she needs from&nbsp;another source, but she would still find it valuable to search for corroboration in&nbsp;court documents to increase the chances that her story reverberates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Finally, litigation affects reputation by shaping the frequency and tenor of media coverage (the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">diffusion</span><span class="font21"> stage). Litigation feeds the media with&nbsp;prepackaged information, or, the way that communication scientists call it:&nbsp;“information subsidies.”<sup>18</sup> Court documents reduce the costs to journalists of&nbsp;covering the story. They often provide information that is well documented and&nbsp;detailed, and contains good quotes from internal company documents.&nbsp;Importantly, information from court documents is invaluable for investigative&nbsp;reporters because it is practically </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">libel-proof;</span><span class="font21"> as long as the media reports&nbsp;accurately from court documents, it is shielded from defamation liability.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Indeed, when I analyzed the content of prizewinning investigative reports, I found that over half of them rely heavily on legal sources. In many of them, the&nbsp;most important effects of the law were not in providing the initial tip that led to&nbsp;the story, but rather in providing veracity and depth. The rest of this section&nbsp;expands on this point by introducing the analogy of first-opinion- and second-opinion effects.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark339"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark340"></a>2.2.3 First-Opinion and Second-Opinion Effects</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">Bad news about a company often ignites two reactions. First, the market system’s reaction: stakeholders reducing their willingness to do business with&nbsp;the company. Then, the legal system’s reaction: a plaintiffs’ lawyer files a&nbsp;lawsuit or a regulator initiates an investigation to examine whether the company&nbsp;broke some rules and needs to pay for it. Importantly for our purposes, the&nbsp;process of determining whether to impose legal sanctions produces information&nbsp;on questions such as what top managers knew and when they knew it. In that&nbsp;sense, litigation or regulatory investigations often create another “third-party&nbsp;assessment” of the company’s behavior. And to the extent that such information&nbsp;is made publicly available, it allows market players to reevaluate their&nbsp;assessment of the company’s quality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">In other words, the company’s stakeholders can use the legal system’s lagged version of what and how things happened as a second opinion on their&nbsp;reputation judgments. In the second-opinion analogy, stakeholders are the&nbsp;decision makers, pondering how to update beliefs about a misbehaving&nbsp;company; market arbiters (media, watchdogs, analysts) are the first-opinion&nbsp;givers; and legal arbiters are the second-opinion givers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">To be sure, the fact that another assessment is available does not mean that it will be used. Not all second opinions are effective. In our context, however,&nbsp;the legal system’s version often makes a valuable second opinion, because it&nbsp;complements the market’s initial reaction nicely. Based on what </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 1&nbsp;</span><span class="font21">taught us about reputational judgments, we can generalize that the market will&nbsp;have a reasonable sense of </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">what</span><span class="font21"> happened, but will have problems understanding&nbsp;</span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">how</span><span class="font21"> it happened. When news of corporate misbehavior breaks, stakeholders&nbsp;quickly learn exactly what the product defect was or how hefty a severance&nbsp;package was awarded to the soon-to-be-leaving CEO. But stakeholders have&nbsp;poor information and resort to biased heuristics when trying to interpret whether&nbsp;the event is indicative of future behavior. Perhaps the product defect was an&nbsp;unforeseeable isolated mistake; perhaps the hefty severance package was the&nbsp;only reasonable card that the board could play given the circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Legal arbiters, by contrast, enjoy more fact-finding powers, expertise, and credibility than market arbiters did when they initially judged the event. The&nbsp;discovery process provides market players with better facts. Judges or regulators&nbsp;provide them with better interpretations, helping them assess the intentionality of&nbsp;the act. Judges are arguably seasoned experts in evaluating intentions: in many&nbsp;scenarios the legal doctrine requires a judge to determine the animus associated&nbsp;with a behavior. The legal system’s opinion may thus replace half-truths with&nbsp;verified facts, and bias-laden judgments with expert judgments.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark341"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark342"></a>2.2.4 Motivating Examples</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">To illustrate the law’s second-opinion effects we can start by recasting the motivating examples we used in </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 1</span><span class="font21">. The crisis of Audi’s self-accelerating&nbsp;cars illustrates several flaws in reputational sanctioning, such as misinformed&nbsp;stakeholders and allegation-driven media.<sup>19</sup> The major reputational damage to&nbsp;Audi occurred after CBS’s </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">60Minutes</span><span class="font21"> picked up the self-acceleration allegations&nbsp;and aired a story with dramatic interviews and a (fabricated) visual illustration of&nbsp;a driverless car accelerating. At that point Audi’s reputation among US&nbsp;customers was close to zero. Then, after the immediate market overreaction, the&nbsp;story was picked up by plaintiffs’ lawyers who filed lawsuits and government&nbsp;regulators who initiated investigations. During cross-examination a new crucial&nbsp;piece of information came to light: the featured interviewee from the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">60 Minutes&nbsp;</span><span class="font21">piece admitted to telling the police officer on the scene that she mistook the gas&nbsp;pedal for the brakes. And a thorough investigation by the regulatory agency - the&nbsp;National Highway Traffic Safety Administration - concluded that the cars did&nbsp;not accelerate by themselves. Audi then used the information produced by the&nbsp;legal system to try to correct the noisy information produced by rumor&nbsp;propagators and the media. The company bought full-page ads in major&nbsp;newspapers and simply filled them with quotes from the regulatory report,&nbsp;claiming vindication.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Another earlier example - the Odwalla case - illustrates the flip side: how asymmetric information and judgment biases may lead stakeholders to&nbsp;</span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">underreact.</span><span class="font21"> After Odwalla initially succeeded in convincing the public that the&nbsp;failure was unforeseeable, some of the lawsuits against it reached the discovery&nbsp;stage. The plaintiffs’ lawyers then exposed internal company documents&nbsp;showing that Odwalla’s managers actually knew about the potential health&nbsp;hazards in advance and chose to ignore the warnings. Consequently, the market&nbsp;rethought the trustworthiness of Odwalla, and the company’s reputation took a&nbsp;big dip.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Many other famous corporate debacles display similar second-opinion effects. </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 3</span><span class="font21"> delves into the famous corporate law case around the&nbsp;Disney-Ovitz divorce, and shows that the valence of media coverage of the&nbsp;debacle had become more </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">favorable</span><span class="font21"> toward Disney following the verdict. This is&nbsp;hardly surprising: stakeholders’ initial reactions when reading about corporate&nbsp;misbehavior are plagued by attribution errors and hindsight bias. Once bad news&nbsp;breaks, stakeholders often overreact because they tend to downplay the context&nbsp;and attribute negative outcomes to deep-seated flaws. Judges can balance this&nbsp;tendency, because their version usually spotlights the external conditions&nbsp;surrounding the event in question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">In other types of cases, the legal system’s second opinion helps stakeholders de-bias the information coming from the misbehaving companies.&nbsp;As the debacles of Salomon Brothers and Arthur Andersen illustrate, the legal&nbsp;system can either lend credibility to or discard a company’s version of the&nbsp;events. In 1991, news about Salomon Brothers’ trading shenanigans ignited a&nbsp;media firestorm, which in turn resulted in mass sell-offs of the company’s&nbsp;shares.— The company acted promptly to recover the reputational harm: Warren&nbsp;Buffet took charge and the company offered transparency and full cooperation&nbsp;with the investigation. Salomon’s recovery is widely considered a success story.&nbsp;But </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">why</span><span class="font21"> exactly did the Salomon recovery succeed? After all, many companies&nbsp;follow the same recipe of changing the management and promising to be nice&nbsp;from now on, yet do not recover reputational damages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">In this specific case, the recovery efforts received a boost of credibility from financial regulators. Following the initial outcry, the Justice Department,&nbsp;Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and other government agencies&nbsp;started investigating Salomon. Several months later, the SEC announced that&nbsp;Salomon had agreed to pay a $290 million fine to settle the case. More&nbsp;importantly, the SEC chairman included in his announcement an assessment of&nbsp;the company’s behavior that pretty much certified what the company was&nbsp;claiming. The SEC lent credibility to the company’s attempts to distance itself&nbsp;from the wrongdoing, believing that the “infractions were rooted in individual&nbsp;excess rather than in systemic abuse,” and that current management did right in&nbsp;responding to the misconduct and “purging the company of its rogue elements.”&nbsp;The stock market reacted very positively to the announcement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">By contrast, when Arthur Andersen followed the same recipe in an attempt to distance itself from the Enron debacle, the market was not convinced.<sup>21</sup> This&nbsp;is partly because the legal system produced information that discredited the&nbsp;company’s version. Arthur Andersen claimed that the misbehavior was the work&nbsp;of a single partner, who was subsequently fired. But the prosecutors chose to cut&nbsp;a deal with the singled-out partner, and the trial produced information about how&nbsp;pervasive the problems were, and how the higher-ups in Andersen were aware of&nbsp;them in real time.<sup>22</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Taken together, all these examples illustrate how the legal system can serve as </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">a safety valve</span><span class="font21"> for reputation systems. In instances where market players&nbsp;greatly under or overreacted, the legal system later provides a more balanced&nbsp;perspective of how things happened, thereby allowing market players to go back&nbsp;and correct their initial assessment. Perhaps more importantly and beyond the&nbsp;impact of the legal system on specific under or overreactions after the fact, the&nbsp;mere background threat of litigation affects all future reputational assessments to&nbsp;begin with. We turn to these </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">ex ante</span><span class="font21"> effects now.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark343"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark344"></a>2.2.5 </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Ex ante</span><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;"> Effects</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">Studies across various contexts show that when first-opinion givers anticipate the possibility of an accurate second opinion, they invest more in the accuracy of&nbsp;their initial assessments.— We have ample reason to believe that the analogy&nbsp;applies to our context of providing information on corporate failures. Both the&nbsp;accusers and the accused are disciplined by a credible threat of second opinions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The mere background threat of litigation pushes the accused companies to refrain from lying when denying accusations. Indeed, crisis management experts&nbsp;explicitly advise their clients to be disciplined in how they fight accusations,&nbsp;bearing in mind the possibility that their denials will be exposed in discovery as&nbsp;lies.<sup>24</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The background threat of litigation also pushes information intermediaries to make their accusations more accurate. A journalist or a corporate watchdog&nbsp;probably anticipates the possibility that future litigation will surface nuanced&nbsp;information about the behavior it is currently criticizing. Assuming they care&nbsp;about their reputation as a journalist/activist, the possibility of being later&nbsp;exposed as wrong will make them invest more in their initial assessments. It is as&nbsp;if the legal system helps us better assess not only the behavior of business&nbsp;corporations, but also the behavior of corporate watchdogs. Watchdogs that&nbsp;make unfounded accusations can later be exposed as unprofessional. By contrast,&nbsp;high-quality watchdogs can use legal success stories to boast of their&nbsp;effectiveness as compared to their competitors, namely, other watchdogs&nbsp;advancing the same cause. In that sense, the legal system facilitates a market for&nbsp;corporate watchdogs’ reputation.<sup>25</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Indeed, when I sampled websites of prominent corporate watchdogs, I found that almost every website contains a list of “legal victories” describing&nbsp;how watchdog-initiated fights led to hefty damages awards or changes in&nbsp;regulation.— For example, the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), an&nbsp;environmental nongovernmental organization, declares itself “the most effective&nbsp;lobbying and litigating group on environmental issues.”— What makes them so&nbsp;effective, you may ask? Well, for one thing, they tell you, they have an army of&nbsp;500 savvy lawyers, scientists, and policy advocates. The website then refers the&nbsp;visitor to a long list of legal battles that the NRDC has won. To be sure, these&nbsp;anecdotal observations are not enough to prove that the legal system facilitates a&nbsp;better market for watchdog reputation, and more systematic evidence is&nbsp;needed.— Nevertheless, the observations indicate how watchdogs think that&nbsp;success in the legal arena is a good indicator of their competence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">*</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Overall, second-opinion effects reduce the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">enforcement costs</span><span class="font21"> of reputational systems: the costs of calibrating and carrying out responses to detected&nbsp;violations of market norms. In doing so, the second-opinion role of the law&nbsp;coexists and complements nicely the first-opinion role, in which the law helps&nbsp;market players detect violations. We cannot determine with certainty which of&nbsp;these two informational effects is more important, as both depend on the&nbsp;company and issue at hand.— But we can observe, more generally, a gradual&nbsp;shift in the informational role of the law: in the past, when markets and&nbsp;information technologies were not as developed, the role of the law in reputation&nbsp;markets was mostly to detect violations.<sup>30</sup> Nowadays, the problem is not so&nbsp;much lack of information, but rather sorting out what pieces of information are&nbsp;more relevant and credible. In a “fake news”/“attention deficit” environment,&nbsp;adjudication is needed not so much to add more information, but rather to&nbsp;spotlight, make sense of, and ensure the veracity of given pieces of information.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark345"></a>2.3 Evidence</span></h4>
<p><span class="font21">The abovementioned examples may have convinced you that the law can occasionally produce a positive externality: quality information on the behavior&nbsp;of powerful players, which then turns into reputational deterrence. Yet&nbsp;evaluating the magnitude of this informational positive externality is a daunting&nbsp;task. Deterrence is notoriously hard to measure, and reputation is a fuzzy&nbsp;concept. To provide some sense of reputational deterrence, I therefore resorted&nbsp;to using a proxy: media coverage of powerful players in government and&nbsp;business.<sup>31</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">A burgeoning multidisciplinary literature documents the important role that media scrutiny plays in corporate governance and politics. I ask the prior&nbsp;question, namely, what determines the effectiveness of media scrutiny: what&nbsp;types of corporate misconduct will the media cover? How it will cover them? In&nbsp;particular, I look at the extent to which media scrutiny relies on court&nbsp;documents. By triangulating several methods - interviewing reporters, going&nbsp;over a reporters-only database of tip sheets, scouring course syllabi in journalism&nbsp;schools, and conducting content analysis of prizewinning journalistic projects - I&nbsp;make the case that litigation is a key source of impactful media coverage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Section 2.3.1</span><span class="font21"> presents the evidence gathered by listening to what journalists say about the role of law as source. As a first step, I interviewed forty veteran&nbsp;reporters, asking about their experience using legal sources. To mitigate the&nbsp;potential biases in an interview method, I evaluated not only what the journalists&nbsp;said when they spoke with me, but also what they say when they talk among&nbsp;themselves and give advice to their colleagues in memoirs, how-to manuals, and&nbsp;tip sheets. Relatedly, I compared basic Investigative Reporting course syllabi&nbsp;from leading journalism schools. </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Section 2.3.2</span><span class="font21"> presents evidence about what&nbsp;journalists actually do. I analyzed the content of prizewinning investigative&nbsp;projects over 1995-2015, and coded the extent to which they relied on legal&nbsp;sources. All these different methods led to the same conclusion: legal sources&nbsp;play a significant role in facilitating accountability journalism.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark346"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark347"></a>2.3.1 Findings from Tip Sheets, Course Syllabi, and Interviews</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">One way to gauge the importance of law as source is to listen to what investigative reporters say about it. And the best place to pick up pointers on&nbsp;how journalists treat sources is investigative reporters’ tip sheets and how-to&nbsp;manuals, whose target audiences are other journalists. The Investigative&nbsp;Reporters’ Organization (IRE) has created a members-only database of tip&nbsp;sheets, containing advice from investigative reporters to their colleagues on a&nbsp;wide range of issues.— I accessed their database and found no fewer than ninety-two tip sheets under the tag of “court documents.” All these tip sheets explicitly&nbsp;refer to the various roles of law as source, underscoring just how important legal&nbsp;sources are to the different phases of the investigative reporter’s work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">To illustrate, one tip sheet, titled “Finding the Story,” contains advice about the initial phase of investigative work.<sup>33</sup> The tip sheet makes it clear from the&nbsp;outset: whenever you investigate a powerful institution, the first thing you need&nbsp;to do is “pull every related suit,” and “scour state agency disciplinary and&nbsp;regulatory reports.” This is because “lawsuits connect us to documents, exhibits,&nbsp;depositions and sources of every type,” and “[e]nforcement actions are rich&nbsp;repositories.” Further, the tip sheet explicitly recognizes the role of lawsuits as a&nbsp;gateway to other sources: “[l]awyers are great sources ... they are document-based creatures - like us - and they often relish media contact.” Then, once&nbsp;lawsuits and regulatory investigations have allowed you to spot a pattern and&nbsp;realize that there is a story, the tip sheet tells you to start researching the story by&nbsp;using another “legal” channel, namely, filing FOIA requests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Such explicit references to law as source are not limited to the IRE’s tip sheet database. I also found them in multiple how-to manuals, textbooks, and&nbsp;scholarly work on investigative reporting.— As one textbook puts it, “Whether in&nbsp;the form of affidavits, motions to sever or judges’ opinions, court filings contain&nbsp;clues to solving a case’s mysteries.”—</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">As another method to gauge the importance of law as source, I interviewed forty investigative reporters. I started every interview with the same big-picture&nbsp;question: “What role does the legal system play in sourcing investigative&nbsp;reports?” Almost every interviewee suggested that the law plays an extremely&nbsp;important role as source. “Huge” and “invaluable” were the most frequently used&nbsp;descriptors.— In the reporters’ own words: “Most serious investigative stories&nbsp;involve court records.”— “Journalism rests heavily on legal sources.”— “[The]&nbsp;relevancy of legal documents is huge ... it is an essential part of investigative&nbsp;reporting.”— “The court system is so integrated in investigative reporting - hard&nbsp;to imagine doing it without them.”<sup>40</sup> “Going to the courts is ingrained in every&nbsp;investigative journalist. The minute I have an idea [for a story], first thing I do,&nbsp;to research the landscape, I go to the court and look for cases.”<sup>41</sup> “[It is] unusual&nbsp;to have a major investigative project without legal documents to buttress some of&nbsp;the findings.”<sup>42</sup> “[Legal sources are] more important than just about any other&nbsp;source of information. I don’t know an investigative reporter that doesn’t rely on&nbsp;documents they get from courts ... Can’t imagine doing an investigative piece&nbsp;without it.”<sup>43</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Importantly, several interviewees qualified their answer to the what-role-do-legal-sources-play question along the lines of “it depends.”<sup>44</sup> They all shared the same theme, namely, that the legal system allows too much information to&nbsp;remain sealed, thereby limiting the actual role that the law plays.<sup>45</sup> In other&nbsp;words, they all agreed that the law can and often does play an important role in&nbsp;sourcing accountability journalism, but lamented that the law’s information&nbsp;production does not reach its potential. We will revisit this theme in </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 7&nbsp;</span><span class="font21">when discussing policy implications.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Several of the reporters I interviewed teach investigative reporting in universities. They all mentioned emphasizing the importance of legal sources to&nbsp;their students. In their words: “I currently tell my journalism students that court&nbsp;records are the most valuable tool a reporter can use.”<sup>46</sup> “One of the&nbsp;cornerstones of journalism school is [to teach the importance of] going to the&nbsp;courthouse and pulling out relevant records.”<sup>47</sup> To corroborate their argument, I&nbsp;looked at the basic investigative reporting course syllabi of leading journalism&nbsp;schools.<sup>48</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">In all but one course syllabus that provided detail on the content of the individual sessions, the class had specific sessions dedicated to learning how to&nbsp;use legal sources.<sup>49</sup> In fact, many courses share a similar structure: in week 1 the&nbsp;students learn what investigative journalism is, and already in weeks 2 or 3 they&nbsp;are learning how to cull and use information from the legal system. The Boston&nbsp;University course dedicates week 2 to gathering information from criminal&nbsp;litigation and week 3 to doing the same from civil litigation. The Berkeley&nbsp;course syllabus not only earmarks week 2 for legal sources, but also highlights&nbsp;knowing how to use legal sources in the one-paragraph course objectives&nbsp;description. The University of Texas-Austin course similarly includes finding&nbsp;information in court records in the “course aims” paragraph. The NYU course&nbsp;goes a step further: after students learn about conventional legal sources in week&nbsp;2, they are introduced to advanced digging techniques in week 3, complete with&nbsp;a tour of the university’s law library and a lesson on how to navigate archived&nbsp;dockets. Further examples abound.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Taken together, the evidence gathered from tip sheets, course syllabi, and interviews overwhelmingly points to the fact that journalists perceive the role of&nbsp;law as source as a crucial element in effective accountability journalism.<sup>51</sup> Still,&nbsp;a skeptic might argue that journalists do not practice what they preach, namely,&nbsp;that in reality they do not rely on legal sources as much as they think they do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Could it be that, for some reason, journalists systematically overstate the role of law as source? To answer this question, we need to go beyond what journalists&nbsp;say and look at what they do: we need to go over the investigative reports and&nbsp;trace the extent to which they actually rely on legal sources.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">As a first, smell-test step, I looked at illustrative case studies of the most famous and impactful investigative reports in history. The single most famous&nbsp;case of holding the government to account - Watergate - is billed in popular&nbsp;culture as a story about anonymous human sources meeting journalists in dark&nbsp;parking garages. Yet a closer look at the story behind the story reveals that&nbsp;Woodward and Bernstein based important parts of their investigative project on&nbsp;documents they received from law enforcement actions. At one point in their&nbsp;memoir, for instance, Woodward and Bernstein describe flying to a Miami&nbsp;courtroom because they wanted to copy the documents produced when the&nbsp;district attorney subpoenaed key bank and phone records.— The most famous&nbsp;case of holding big business to account - the investigative project that&nbsp;popularized the term muckraking journalism - is Ida TarbelTs exposé of the&nbsp;Standard Oil Company at the turn of the twentieth century.— Here the role of&nbsp;law as source cannot be more pronounced: TarbelTs reporting rested heavily on&nbsp;court documents, regulatory investigation reports, and depositions.— The list&nbsp;goes on, and subsequent chapters provide ample examples.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Casual observations therefore support what journalists say, namely, that legal sources indeed play a key role in important work in accountability&nbsp;journalism. To further corroborate the law-as-source argument, we now turn to a&nbsp;more systematic examination of the legal system’s role in facilitating media&nbsp;scrutiny.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark348"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark349"></a>2.3.2 Findings from Content Analysis of Prizewinning Investigative&nbsp;Reports</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">Aside from listening to what journalists say, we can read what journalists produce, and then reverse-engineer to find out how much of the journalistic&nbsp;output is based on legal-sourcing inputs. To this end, I coded prizewinning&nbsp;investigative projects between 1995 and 2015. I went over all the projects that&nbsp;won the Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting or the IRE medal,— and&nbsp;supplemented the sample with specific examples of investigative business&nbsp;journalism that won the Loeb award.— I asked what legal sources (direct and&nbsp;indirect) allowed the production of such socially beneficial investigative reports.&nbsp;The content analysis shows that legal sources play a strong “but-for” role in over&nbsp;half of the prizewinning investigative projects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Methodology</span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">.</span><span class="font21"> Before we get to the findings, a few words on methodology are in order.— First, the sampling criterion: why sample only prizewinning&nbsp;investigative reports? After all, prizewinning projects are, by definition, outliers&nbsp;that do not represent the entire population of accountability journalism. Yet, for&nbsp;this book’s purposes, there exist at least two good reasons to sample such&nbsp;outliers. Looking at the stories that win journalistic awards can tell us something&nbsp;about industry norms.— Award-winning projects may not reflect the average&nbsp;investigative report, but they do reflect the industry’s exemplary standards: what&nbsp;journalists think accountability journalism ought to look like. Importantly,&nbsp;prizewinning projects reflect the investigative reports that had the most impact&nbsp;on society. In other words, by sampling Pulitzers we get a good proxy for the&nbsp;kind of journalism that this book focuses on: journalism that holds the powerful&nbsp;to account (in our terms: journalism that generates reputational deterrence). If we&nbsp;wish to examine the indirect (informational) role of the law in facilitating media-driven reputational accountability, then it makes sense to focus on the kind of&nbsp;media work that produces the most accountability.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">In fact, even if we do not treat prizewinning reports as a sample meant to represent a larger “population” (of all investigative reports), but rather treat it as&nbsp;the entire relevant population (of prizewinning investigative reports), we still&nbsp;have a significant finding in our hands. That is, assume for the sake of argument&nbsp;that prizewinning investigative reports are the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">only</span><span class="font21"> reports that rely on legal&nbsp;sources. Still, each of these reports - as Hamilton convincingly showed— -makes on average an eight-digit-sized impact on society, and thus demonstrates&nbsp;that reliance on legal sources is in itself an important phenomenon worthy of&nbsp;further consideration. Moreover, there is reason to believe that purposively&nbsp;sampling only the top investigative works is likely to </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">understate</span><span class="font21"> the law-as-source claims. Investigative reporting textbooks, and the Pulitzer winners I&nbsp;interviewed, suggest that the likelihood of winning the Pulitzer category of&nbsp;investigative reporting goes up when the submitted story emanates from the&nbsp;reporter’s original digging.<sup>61</sup> Relying on regulatory documents can become a&nbsp;double-edged sword in such contexts: “You win Pulitzers when [new] regulation&nbsp;follows your investigation, not when your investigation follows regulation.”<sup>62&nbsp;</sup>The upshot is that if one can find legal sourcing in the investigative reporting&nbsp;awards, one can find it anywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Out of the relevant investigative reporting prizes, I sampled two: Pulitzers and IRE medals. I went over all of the winning projects in the investigative&nbsp;reporting category of the Pulitzers, as well as all of the IRE medals given for&nbsp;print journalism between 1995 and 2015. The sample included twenty-five&nbsp;Pulitzers and thirty IRE medals (as in some years there were co-winners). Once&nbsp;we subtract the redundancies - investigative reports that won both the Pulitzer&nbsp;and the IRE medal in the same year - we have forty-eight unique projects in our&nbsp;sample.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">After deciding on the sample, I had to settle on criteria for deciphering the role that legal sources play: first identifying all the sources a story relies on, and&nbsp;then determining what relative weight to assign to legal sources. Prizewinning&nbsp;projects, after all, rest on more than a single source. They usually triangulate&nbsp;various human sources and documents. Deciphering the role of legal sources&nbsp;necessitated distinguishing between documents produced by other state agencies,&nbsp;such as death records, and documents produced by the legal system, such as&nbsp;regulatory investigation reports. Among documents produced by the legal&nbsp;system, I further distinguished between information received through direct&nbsp;sourcing channels, such as FOIA requests, and information received through&nbsp;indirect sourcing channels, such as depositions produced during litigation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The most challenging and subjective task was assigning relative weight to legal sources. I assigned a “strong” role to legal sources whenever the legal&nbsp;sources seemed to play a “but-for” role, meaning that the story would have been&nbsp;significantly different (or even not published) had it not been for legal sources. I&nbsp;assigned a “medium” role to legal sources whenever the story would have stood&nbsp;on its own even without legal sources, but the legal sources provided an added&nbsp;layer of important detail and credibility. A “weak” role was assigned when the&nbsp;legal sources added detail and background that was of little consequence to the&nbsp;key points in the project. A couple of prizewinning projects did not seem to use&nbsp;legal sources at all, earning them a “nonexistent” role.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">While it is true that content analysis done by human coders is always subject to limitations,— I took two steps to increase the findings’ reliability.&nbsp;First, two coders (a research assistant and myself) went over all the Pulitzer&nbsp;articles, and the intercoder reliability was high.— Second, I approached the&nbsp;prizewinners themselves, asking them to evaluate the role they assigned to legal&nbsp;sources in their own story. The majority of reporters assigned similar or stronger&nbsp;legal-sourcing weights to their stories than the ones I had originally assigned. To&nbsp;the extent that my subjective coding misrepresents the true reliance on legal&nbsp;sources, it does so in ways that only understate my claim for heavy reliance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Findings.—</span><span class="font21"> In twenty-three of the twenty-five (92 percent) Pulitzer-winning projects, legal sources played some role. In thirteen of them, legal sources played a </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">strong</span><span class="font21"> role, meaning that at least parts of the story could not&nbsp;have been written without them. Similarly, in twenty of the twenty-three IRE&nbsp;medal-winning projects, legal sources were explicitly mentioned in the one-paragraph description of how the story came about.— Roughly speaking, it&nbsp;appears that in the majority of paradigmatic cases of accountability journalism,&nbsp;the legal system plays a strong role.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Delving deeper into the stories where legal sources played a strong role, I looked at whether the information came from direct or indirect channels. In four&nbsp;of the thirteen Pulitzers, the strong reliance on legal sources came from the direct&nbsp;channel of FOIA requests, with litigation and regulatory investigations playing&nbsp;smaller roles. A good example is the 2009 project on how the Pentagon used&nbsp;retired generals to influence public opinion. The reporters successfully sued the&nbsp;Defense Department to get 8,000 pages of emails, transcripts, and records. They&nbsp;then presented visuals of the internal emails in small boxes throughout the text,&nbsp;thus adding credibility and packing a punch. The 2015 project about special&nbsp;interest groups influencing state attorneys similarly relied heavily on FOIA&nbsp;requests and, to a much lesser extent, on law enforcement actions. The reporter&nbsp;in this case used open records laws to obtain 6,000 emails exchanged between&nbsp;corporate representatives and attorneys general. This allowed him to make “an&nbsp;airtight case by relying on the players’ own words to show how the lobbying&nbsp;worked and how effectively.”— A similar pattern emerges with IRE medals: in&nbsp;three of the twenty-three stories I sampled, the reporters mention FOIA requests&nbsp;but do not mention litigation when explaining how the story came about.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">In seven of the thirteen Pulitzers with heavy reliance on legal sources, indirect sourcing - litigation or regulatory investigations - played a strong role,&nbsp;with direct sourcing channels playing smaller or nonexistent roles. An example&nbsp;of a story relying on regulatory investigations is the 2008 project on toxic&nbsp;ingredients imported from China.<sup>68</sup> There, the reporters drew extensively from&nbsp;investigations of Chinese manufacturers conducted by regulators around the&nbsp;world. An example of a story relying on litigation comes from the 2005 story of&nbsp;an Oregonian governor’s sexual misconduct with a teen. There, the story hinges&nbsp;upon information coming from once-sealed documents in a settled lawsuit&nbsp;between the 14-year-old and the governor.— The IRE sample offers a similar&nbsp;observation: in nine of the twenty-three winning projects, the reporters explicitly&nbsp;mentioned getting information from law enforcement actions as key to the story.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Some prizewinning projects relied heavily on both direct and indirect legal sources. In two of the thirteen Pulitzers in which legal sources played a strong&nbsp;role, the reporters needed a combination of FOIA legal battles and court&nbsp;documents to make the story impactful. The reporters behind the 2008 co-winner&nbsp;- a project on lax regulation of baby products - started digging by filing a FOIA&nbsp;request to the product safety commission for information regarding unsafe cribs&nbsp;and toddler car seats. The thousands of documents they received led them to&nbsp;specific lawsuits, and the court documents describing lack of care by the&nbsp;manufacturers and lack of diligence by the regulators allowed them to fully flesh&nbsp;out the story. The 2015 project on healthcare providers milking Medicare money&nbsp;was jump-started by direct sourcing channels: the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Wall Street Journal</span><span class="font21"> won a&nbsp;legal battle to get Medicare physician-payment data, and that data formed the&nbsp;basis for the project’s earlier reports. In subsequent reports,— the journalists&nbsp;concretized and personalized the story by relying on specific regulatory&nbsp;investigation reports. For IRE medals, the results were more pronounced: eight&nbsp;of the twenty-three winning projects mention both FOIA requests and law&nbsp;enforcement actions as key to the development of the story.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Finally, it is interesting to learn from counterexamples: in three of the twenty-five Pulitzers, the legal system played little or no role. These were the&nbsp;2013 project on Walmart’s bribing practices in Mexico, and the 2004 and 2000&nbsp;projects on atrocities by the US army in the Vietnam War and the Korean War,&nbsp;respectively. In the Walmart bribes story, the reporters relied on interviews with&nbsp;whistleblowers, internal company documents they somehow obtained, and&nbsp;independent work, meticulously matching zoning plans and approvals with&nbsp;corporate payment records. In the war atrocities stories, the reporters relied on&nbsp;declassified military documents and interviews with victims and military&nbsp;personnel. In all three projects, reporters had few legal documents to cull, simply&nbsp;because the victims had no recourse to the legal system.<sup>71</sup> Interestingly, all these&nbsp;stories focus on non-American victims, and so the American legal system was&nbsp;not invoked and did not produce information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">These counterexamples remind us that the legal system’s ability to facilitate reputational control is limited, serving as segue to the </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">next section</span><span class="font21">, which refines&nbsp;the theory by accommodating its limitations.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark350"></a>2.4 Refining the Basic Story: Limitations&nbsp;and Multiple Layers</span></h4>
<p><span class="font21">So far, we have focused on “success stories,” namely, instances where the legal system helped market players judge reputations better. But under certain (not&nbsp;uncommon) conditions, the legal system cannot help the market for reputation.&nbsp;Sometimes the legal system has trouble producing relevant information. Other&nbsp;times, the legal system may produce valuable information, yet stakeholders will&nbsp;not act on it. In other words, the legal system, even when it operates perfectly,&nbsp;cannot cure all the biases of reputational sanctions. </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Section 2.4.1</span><span class="font21"> identifies the&nbsp;limitations of the legal system’s reputational effects. </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Section 2.4.2</span><span class="font21"> then puts&nbsp;these limitations in perspective: the fact that both the legal and market systems&nbsp;are flawed does not mean that reputational deterrence will not work. As long as&nbsp;each system’s flaws are imperfectly correlated with each other’s, the interactions&nbsp;between law and reputation will generate valuable deterrence.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark351"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark352"></a>2.4.1 Limitations</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">Some of the limitations of the law’s reputational effects stem from the legal system’s inability to generate relevant information. The legal system’s&nbsp;assessments sometimes suffer from distortions similar to the ones that plague&nbsp;reputation systems: asymmetric information, lack of expertise, strategic&nbsp;behavior, and divergent incentives. There exist ample situations where we&nbsp;cannot trust the legal system to produce the positive externality of accurate&nbsp;reputation information. For example, information produced during litigation may&nbsp;be </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">too lagged.</span><span class="font21"> Often the judge’s opinion comes a few years after the initial&nbsp;market reaction, when no one is interested in the matter anymore.— Still, while&nbsp;the time lag indeed represents a strong limitation, we should not overstate it.&nbsp;Remember that the relevant event for measuring the lag is not the day on which&nbsp;the legal case is decided, but rather any day on which the legal system injects&nbsp;information into the market. Many times valuable facts become available in the&nbsp;earlier stages of the litigation process. Judges also provide interpretations of how&nbsp;things happened long before the final judicial opinion: adjudication often&nbsp;happens in multiple stages, and judges speak their mind during early stages such&nbsp;as motions to dismiss or class/derivative action approvals. Indeed, this will be a&nbsp;recurring theme in </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapters 3</span><span class="font21"> and 8, which deal with (the usually front-loaded)&nbsp;corporate and securities litigation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Other limitations stem from the fact that even when the law produces quality information, stakeholders may not act on it. There are certain biases in&nbsp;reputational sanctioning that legal information cannot fix. The law can help&nbsp;stakeholders fix some attribution errors, as in discerning whether product defects&nbsp;are endemic or idiosyncratic. But the law cannot solve stakeholders’ limited&nbsp;attention problems, or lack of motivation to act. Also, the law will have a more&nbsp;pronounced effect on stakeholders’ judgments in areas of corporate behavior that&nbsp;they do not experience directly, such as the company’s social responsibility&nbsp;policies (</span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 5</span><span class="font21"> elaborates), or its management’s integrity (</span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapters 3</span><span class="font21"> and 4&nbsp;elaborate), relative to issues that stakeholders experience directly, such as the&nbsp;quality of the product’s human-interaction design.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The law also cannot cure some of the key media biases. The law can rid the media from its dependence on inside sources, and reduce the costs of reporting&nbsp;on misbehavior by powerful players. But the law cannot cure the media from the&nbsp;need to cater to their readers’ biases, or from inability to report properly on&nbsp;information generated by the legal system. As the </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">next section</span><span class="font21"> elaborates, in&nbsp;many cases information from the courtroom gets lost in translation on its way to&nbsp;the court of public opinion. The media will over-report on vivid issues and&nbsp;under-report on opaque issues. Indeed, we should acknowledge that litigation&nbsp;would meaningfully affect reputation only in a small subset of legal disputes&nbsp;(such as with big-firm defendants), which are interesting and important enough&nbsp;for third parties to follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Similarly, the background threat of litigation will not be enough to prevent companies from falsely denying accusations, under certain circumstances. Think&nbsp;for example about a CEO nearing retirement, or a company on the brink of&nbsp;insolvency. These actors have a high discount rate: they need to recover their&nbsp;reputation now, and care about the long term less. As a result, they may choose&nbsp;to bend the truth and not worry about the risk that they will be exposed by the&nbsp;legal system further down the road.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">In all, the legal system does not always produce valuable information, and even when it does, it cannot cure us of all our emotional and cognitive biases in&nbsp;processing information.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark353"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark354"></a>2.4.2 Multiple Layers of Reputation Information</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">We acknowledged that the legal system is not categorically better or more accurate than reputation systems. And so I emphasize that I do not portray here a&nbsp;horserace over who produces better information, with the legal system winning.&nbsp;But I do portray the legal and market systems as providing multiple layers of&nbsp;reputation information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The value of the legal system to reputation systems stems largely from the fact that the systems’ distortions are imperfectly correlated. The market’s first&nbsp;opinion enjoys advantages in some areas and disadvantages in other areas&nbsp;compared to the legal system’s second opinion. The two systems in effect create&nbsp;one </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">diversifiedportfolio</span><span class="font21"> of reputational assessments. Having different types of&nbsp;assessments mitigate the risk of extreme mistakes (that is, the risk that&nbsp;stakeholders will boycott perfectly good companies or interact with rotten&nbsp;companies). The idea of multiple layers of evaluations has been applied to&nbsp;similar contexts such as second opinions in medical treatment and user reviews&nbsp;in online commerce websites,— and it lends itself nicely to our context. Consider&nbsp;for example the four traits that were identified as necessary for well-functioning&nbsp;reputation systems: the system has to produce information in a timely,&nbsp;accessible, accurate, and thorough manner.— It is easy to envision how the&nbsp;market and legal system complement each other along these dimensions. The&nbsp;market system provides more timely and accessible information, striking fast&nbsp;whenever bad news breaks. The legal system then produces information that is&nbsp;often more accurate and complete than the market’s initial version.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Overall, then, the existence of a well-functioning legal system facilitates better reputation systems. Still, in order to move from claims about the average&nbsp;and improve our ability to predict the reputational impact of specific disputes,&nbsp;we need to introduce more context-specific details and focus on one area of&nbsp;market activity and law at a time. The </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">next section</span><span class="font21"> shows how to apply the&nbsp;theory to specific contexts and identify the factors that determine the likely&nbsp;direction of reputational impact.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark355"></a>2.5 Variation: What Explains the Magnitude&nbsp;and Direction of Reputational Effects</span></h4>
<p><span class="font21">To further complicate the basic story, this section fleshes out five factors to consider before we can apply the reputation-through-litigation perspective to&nbsp;specific contexts. The first three factors concern the counterintuitive </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">direction</span><span class="font21"> of&nbsp;the reputational effects. Litigation does not always hurt the defendant-company’s&nbsp;reputation. </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Section 2.5.1</span><span class="font21"> highlights the wedge between individual-level and&nbsp;organizational-level reputations. Under certain (quite common) conditions,&nbsp;litigation creates a scapegoating dynamic, hurting the individual manager’s&nbsp;reputation while boosting the company’s reputation. </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Section 2.5.2</span><span class="font21"> distinguishes&nbsp;between the reputational effects of the process of litigation and those of judicial&nbsp;opinions. Counterintuitively, under certain conditions losing the legal case, or&nbsp;being scolded by the judge, may actually be good for the defendant-company’s&nbsp;reputation. </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Section 2.5.3</span><span class="font21"> emphasizes the forces that drive a wedge between&nbsp;information that is being produced in the legal system and stakeholders’ actual&nbsp;reputational decisions. A lot of information gets lost in translation from the&nbsp;courtroom to the court of public opinion, either because the media is not&nbsp;reporting it, or because the company manages to hijack the information flow by&nbsp;producing smokescreens. As a result, even when the legal system produces&nbsp;damning information about the defendant-company, the company’s stakeholders&nbsp;may not act on it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The other two factors concern the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">magnitude</span><span class="font21"> of the reputational effects. Not all litigation affects reputation. </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Section 2.5.4</span><span class="font21"> maps the areas of the law where the&nbsp;magnitude of reputational effects should be higher, on paper. And </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Section 2.5.5&nbsp;</span><span class="font21">provides evidence from the law-as-source study, suggesting that litigation plays&nbsp;a bigger role in facilitating reputational control of private business than it does&nbsp;facilitating reputational control of public entities.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark356"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark357"></a>2.5.1 Litigation Affects the Reputation of Individuais Differently than</span><br><br><a name="bookmark356"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">It Affects Companies</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">When analyzing reputational impact we have to distinguish between individual-level and organizational-level reputations. Legal scholars tend to assume that any judicial scorning of individuals reflects badly on their companies, and vice&nbsp;versa. And granted, in many cases this intuitive assumption holds. Yet, as&nbsp;reputation and crisis management scholars have long recognized, scolding an&nbsp;individual does not </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">necessarily</span><span class="font21"> impact the company’s reputation negatively.— In&nbsp;general, factors such as the scolded individual’s place in the hierarchy, whether&nbsp;the individual still holds office, or what other top managers knew about that&nbsp;individual’s actions, play an important role in dictating the link between&nbsp;individual scolding and corporate reputation. Specifically in the context of&nbsp;litigation, we can envision common scenarios where dressing down specific&nbsp;managers may actually boost the company’s reputation (or at least not hurt it).</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">First, singling out an individual for scorning may facilitate </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">scapegoating </span><span class="font21">dynamics. In typical corporate litigation scenarios - class/derivative actions -the claim is often jumpstarted by a sharp decline in stock prices (which&nbsp;constitutes the harm to the investor and draws the attention of plaintiff lawyers).&nbsp;And because the stock price decline is likely to push the manager out, by the&nbsp;time judges get to write their opinions they probably dress down a manager who&nbsp;is already gone or on the way out of the company. While such judicial scorning&nbsp;probably hurts the ousted manager’ s chances of being rehired (that is, hurts the&nbsp;manager’s labor-market reputation), it could help repair the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">company's&nbsp;</span><span class="font21">reputation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">To understand why, note that the crisis management literature considers “decoupling” as one of the most effective recovery strategies for companies.<sup>76</sup> In&nbsp;decoupling mode, the company is acknowledging the problem while isolating&nbsp;and localizing it, conveying a message along the lines of “this is not who we are&nbsp;as a company going forward.” Assigning blame to a single individual who was&nbsp;since purged from the company can be an especially effective form of&nbsp;decoupling, as long as the public believes it.<sup>77</sup> Thus, when judges single out the&nbsp;ousted manager for opprobrium, they lend credibility to the scapegoating&nbsp;attempts, thereby helping the company distance itself from the wrongdoing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Another common occurrence in judicial scolding involves criticizing a manager for making mistakes out of incompetence. Here again, the individual’s&nbsp;chances of being rehired would probably go down as a result of litigation. But&nbsp;the impact on the company’s reputation is not necessarily negative, and could&nbsp;even be positive. Crisis management experts maintain that companies in crises&nbsp;stand a better chance of repairing their reputation when individual managers are&nbsp;portrayed as less than perfect— If stakeholders perceive the leader as perfect and&nbsp;in total control, they assume that she could have prevented the adverse outcome.&nbsp;As a result, stakeholders will interpret the company’s misconduct as intentional&nbsp;and indicative of future behavior (that is, arising from deep-rooted disregard for&nbsp;shareholder interests and market norms in general). By contrast, if stakeholders&nbsp;perceive the leader as less than perfect, they are more likely to interpret the&nbsp;adverse outcomes as a result of more easily fixable mistakes.<sup>79</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 3</span><span class="font21"> uses the famous corporate law case of </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Disney</span><span class="font21"> to illustrate scapegoating dynamics in play. Without forecasting too much, let us note that&nbsp;while dozens of law review articles referred to the caustic judicial scolding&nbsp;included in the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Disney</span><span class="font21"> opinion, one aspect of the scolding has been grossly&nbsp;overlooked: </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">whose</span><span class="font21"> reputation was damaged exactly? Who were the targets of the&nbsp;scolding? As </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 3</span><span class="font21"> shows, the chancellor’s strongest criticisms were&nbsp;reserved for six individuals who were no longer an integral part of Disney when&nbsp;the verdict was issued. </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 3</span><span class="font21"> relies on media coverage of the Disney debacle&nbsp;before and after litigation, to show that the company’s reputation for&nbsp;management integrity actually gained from the scolding of these already ousted&nbsp;individuals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The gap between individual- and organizational-level reputations also works in the other direction: litigation may hurt a company’s reputation while&nbsp;helping individual managers salvage their own reputations. So far, our&nbsp;discussion has implicitly assumed that corporate insiders try to maximize the&nbsp;firm’s reputation. In reality, though, managers may protect their own reputation&nbsp;at the expense of the company’s reputation. Agency problems that plague large&nbsp;corporations loom even larger at times of crisis and legal disputes. Decision&nbsp;makers facing an end-game situation think even more than usual about their own&nbsp;interests instead of the company’s interests.— For instance, corporate managers&nbsp;may push for early settlements even when litigation can recover damage to the&nbsp;company’s reputation.<sup>81</sup> This is because litigation may harm the managers’&nbsp;individual reputation or because litigation may increase the chances that&nbsp;managers will have to pay out of pocket.<sup>82</sup> Analyses of the relationship between&nbsp;law and reputation should therefore find a way to incorporate agency&nbsp;considerations.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark358"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark359"></a>2.5.2 The Process of Litigation Matters More than the Outcomes</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">When we think about the reputational impact of litigation we usually focus on judicial opinions: how the outcomes (legal sanctions) or content (judicial&nbsp;remarks) of opinions shape the reputation of defendants.— But in reality judicial&nbsp;opinions are rare. Most legal disputes settle.— Yet even cases that settle&nbsp;sometimes affect the market reaction: the process itself prior to settlements&nbsp;(pleading, discovery, and trial) sheds light on reputation-relevant information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">To illustrate, recall that the Odwalla lawsuit settled, but not before the discovery process corrected the initial market reaction by flushing out important&nbsp;information. Another example comes from Selmi’s study of stock market&nbsp;reaction to settlements of racial discrimination class actions.— The study&nbsp;indicates that similar cases with similar legal outcomes yielded different market&nbsp;reactions, depending on what information was produced prior to settlement. For&nbsp;example, Texaco’s reputation took a hit when the media reported about a tape&nbsp;with explicit racial slurs that was exposed in discovery.<sup>86</sup> And we have&nbsp;systematic indications that sophisticated market players indeed constantly&nbsp;monitor disputes and react to events during the early stages of the process.<sup>87</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Note that the litigation process’s impact on reputation differs markedly from the impact of judicial opinions. The process mainly affects what&nbsp;information we have, while judicial opinions mainly affect how we process that&nbsp;information.<sup>88</sup> In disputes with large, publicly traded firms, market players will&nbsp;likely have access to the basic facts about the misbehavior before a lawsuit is&nbsp;even filed. Still, information produced during pleading, discovery, and trial can&nbsp;give market players more raw facts and inside information to work with, such as&nbsp;internal email communications or board minutes that provide details about what&nbsp;top managers did (or did not do) to prevent the failure. In other words, even&nbsp;when the process of litigation does not affect the revelation stage, it can&nbsp;significantly affect the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">attribution</span><span class="font21"> stage: providing information not on what&nbsp;happened but rather on how it happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">By contrast, judicial opinions would affect mainly the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">certification</span><span class="font21"> and </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">diffusion</span><span class="font21"> stages. By the time judicial opinions are released in such disputes, they&nbsp;probably contain mostly stale information; stakeholders with enough stake and&nbsp;expertise to mine verdicts for information could have already accessed prior&nbsp;sources for the same information. To be sure, verdicts still matter in the court of&nbsp;public opinion. But they matter in different and hitherto understudied ways. The&nbsp;main impact of verdicts is not in introducing new information but rather in&nbsp;affecting how existing information is processed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Judicial opinions shape the scope and content of media coverage by raising the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">saliency</span><span class="font21"> of an issue. A certain issue may be long past its days in the sun&nbsp;when a lagged judicial opinion enlivens the media attention to it, providing the&nbsp;media reporters with readymade quotes. Judicial opinions also change&nbsp;reputations by affecting the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">credibility</span><span class="font21"> of a given framing of the issue. They&nbsp;certify certain versions of what and how things happened. Recall the source-credibility effects we mentioned in </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 1</span><span class="font21">: the same piece of information&nbsp;may be discounted when coming from a non-credible source, yet move the&nbsp;needle when coming from a credible one. When well-respected judges put their&nbsp;name on a certain version of the events, stakeholders are more likely to update&nbsp;their beliefs based on it.<sup>89</sup> The judge’s version therefore affects how market&nbsp;players package an existing set of facts in their minds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Beyond the content of judicial opinions (the judge’s version of what and how things happened), there are also interesting dynamics with the legal&nbsp;outcomes of the case. It is intuitive to think that the legal outcome of a case will&nbsp;determine its reputational outcome: companies that lose in litigation will suffer&nbsp;reputational damage, and those that win will enjoy a reputational rebound.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Yet a deeper look reveals that legal outcomes are imperfectly correlated, and sometimes even negatively correlated, with reputational outcomes. Two&nbsp;enforcement actions with identical legal outcomes may generate completely&nbsp;different reputational outcomes. This is because the legal outcome of a case is&nbsp;based on specific legal doctrines that may not be relevant to the stakeholders’&nbsp;reputation evaluation. For example, a judge may rule in favor of the defendant&nbsp;company, yet the judicial opinion will contain harsh remarks indicating that the&nbsp;company disregarded market norms, though it fell short of violating legal rules.&nbsp;In such cases, the legal consequences will be positive but the reputational&nbsp;consequences negative. Conversely, a judge may assign liability to the company,&nbsp;but the opinion will make clear that the misbehavior was carried out by a rogue&nbsp;employee and is unlikely to reoccur. In that case the legal consequences will be&nbsp;negative, but the reputational consequences are likely to be positive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Indeed, various empirical studies of stock market reactions to enforcement actions show that there is no systematic correlation between the size of the legal&nbsp;sanction and that of the reputational sanction.<sup>90</sup> To further illustrate we need&nbsp;simply revisit the Salomon Brothers case. As mentioned, the market reacted very&nbsp;positively to Salomon’s settlement with the regulators. But the positive reaction&nbsp;cannot be attributed to the legal outcome: Salomon agreed to pay what was then&nbsp;the second-highest fine ever paid in SEC settlements, and had to double its initial&nbsp;charge-out (indicating a higher-than-expected legal sanction).<sup>91</sup> The positive&nbsp;market reaction is therefore more likely attributable to the information contained&nbsp;in the settlement announcement, which suggested that Salomon’s past mistakes&nbsp;are not indicative of how the company is managed now. Another example - the&nbsp;Bankers Trust litigation - illustrates the flip side.<sup>92</sup> There, a financial giant won&nbsp;a series of legal battles, but the legal victory proved pyrrhic. The process of&nbsp;litigation exposed the pervasiveness of a sucker-punching culture in Bankers&nbsp;Trust, thus greatly damaging the firm’s reputation.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark360"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark361"></a>2.5.3 The Information Flow from the Courtroom Gets Distorted</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">So far, we have assumed that stakeholders use information from the legal system to revisit their reputational assessments. But in reality information from the&nbsp;courtroom does not simply find its way to stakeholders intact. Individuals rarely&nbsp;read unfiltered court opinions or regulatory reports. They depend on information&nbsp;intermediaries to process and disseminate the main sound bites for them. Yet&nbsp;intermediaries have their own narrow interests to select what parts to highlight&nbsp;and then add their own take. And the misbehaving companies themselves also&nbsp;distort the information flow. As a result, a lot of information gets lost in&nbsp;translation. Consider two especially notable patterns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">First, different types of intermediaries - such as law firms, business media, or regular newspapers - select different pieces of information to convey to their&nbsp;respective audiences. Take for example the lessons learned from my analysis of&nbsp;the coverage of the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Disney</span><span class="font21"> litigation.<sup>93</sup> Big law firms tend to send “a&nbsp;memorandum to our clients” following significant cases, and did so with </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Disney&nbsp;</span><span class="font21">as well. When I sampled these memos, I discovered an “all-rules” approach: the&nbsp;law firms focused on what the verdict means for directors facing similar&nbsp;situations in the future in general terms. They largely refrained from relaying the&nbsp;detailed narrative of what and how things happened in Disney. By contrast, the&nbsp;newspaper coverage of the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Disney</span><span class="font21"> decision focused more on the judge’s caustic&nbsp;criticism and vivid descriptions rather than on the legal doctrines. Even there,&nbsp;different types of media outlets produced markedly different types of coverage.&nbsp;The business media’s coverage was more favorable to Disney than the regular&nbsp;media’s coverage. Business newspapers were forward-looking: they focused on&nbsp;how the bottom line of the verdict is good for Disney and its current directors&nbsp;going forward, while associating the caustic criticism in the verdict with the&nbsp;retiring CEO. Regular newspapers, by contrast, were more backward-looking:&nbsp;they focused on the crushing criticism delivered in the verdict, and painted it as&nbsp;bad for everyone involved.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The variation in the coverage of verdicts carries important implications for reputational outcomes. Reputational outcomes vary across the company’s&nbsp;different audiences, as each stakeholder group typically taps different&nbsp;intermediaries for information. To illustrate: directors who read just the law&nbsp;firms’ memos will have different perceptions of the company than investors who&nbsp;read the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Wall Street Journal,</span><span class="font21"> or customers who read the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">HuffPost</span><span class="font21"> online. In the&nbsp;</span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Disney</span><span class="font21"> case, the reputational outcomes were likely zero for audiences relying on&nbsp;law firms’ coverage; negative for audiences relying on regular newspapers; and&nbsp;mixed (or even positive) for audiences relying on business newspapers. The&nbsp;upshot is that future analyses of the reputational impact of litigation should&nbsp;distinguish between different types of audiences and sources of diffusion of&nbsp;reputation-relevant information.<sup>95</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">A second important factor to consider is defendant companies’ attempts to produce smokescreens that divert the public’s attention away from bad&nbsp;information coming out of the courtroom. To go back to the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Disney</span><span class="font21"> example: the&nbsp;verdict was not the only newsworthy event affecting Disney’s reputation at the&nbsp;time. At the exact day that the verdict was released, Disney issued a quarterly&nbsp;report announcing strong earnings growth. The media attention quickly turned&nbsp;away from the verdict and to these positive announcements. Disney’s&nbsp;stakeholders ended up reading a commingled story of earning announcement and&nbsp;a verdict, framed by the media as a good day overall for Disney.<sup>96</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Encountering the overlooked smokescreen angle of the Disney story illustrates that reputational sanctions are not a one-sided event. As </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 1&nbsp;</span><span class="font21">showed, companies have the incentives and ability (think public relations&nbsp;departments) to hijack unfavorable information flows. When discussing the&nbsp;informational role of the law we should therefore consider what conditions make&nbsp;information flows more (or less) likely to get hijacked by companies. I&nbsp;conjecture that companies can control the information flows from verdicts better&nbsp;than they control information flows from continuous discovery or trial processes.&nbsp;Verdicts are one-time, isolated events, so companies can more easily produce a&nbsp;timely smokescreen, issuing an unrelated press release to steer media attention&nbsp;away from the verdict.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">At first glance, the observed distortions in information flows cast a doubt on the legal system’s ability to impact reputational sanctions. It can be argued&nbsp;that the media will not widely diffuse corrections of market overreactions&nbsp;(because nuanced, contextual explanations do not sell newspapers like vivid,&nbsp;template-like allegations), and that companies’ smokescreens will prevent&nbsp;corrections of market underreaction. However, a deeper look reveals the&nbsp;“multiple layers” dynamic we touched on the </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">previous section</span><span class="font21">: the distortions in&nbsp;information flows are imperfectly correlated and somewhat balance each other:</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">When the media fails to fully diffuse information that is favorable to companies, the companies themselves have incentives and resources to make&nbsp;sure that stakeholders get the message. To illustrate, recall how Audi purchased&nbsp;full-page ads in major newspapers to increase the public exposure to the&nbsp;exonerating regulatory report. The Exxon Valdez Spill serves as another good&nbsp;illustration. Exxon’s spokespersons continue to refer to parts of the judicial&nbsp;opinion in the spill-damages litigation that commended Exxon. For example,&nbsp;when an Alaskan politician brought up the Exxon failure in 2004, the company&nbsp;issued a press release quoting the judicial opinion, suggesting that no one can&nbsp;claim that they are the bad guys anymore.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">And in instances where companies try to prevent unfavorable information flows, sophisticated intermediaries have incentives to expose the company for&nbsp;the “villain” that it is (recall the Odwalla example).</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark362"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark363"></a>2.5.4 The Reputational Impact Depends on the Market Activity and&nbsp;Legal Field in Question</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">One final tuning of the reputation-through-litigation argument is in order, before we move to specific legal applications in the next four chapters. The magnitude&nbsp;of reputational impact varies greatly across different types of legal disputes. One&nbsp;way to identify the conditions that determine whether a given dispute will affect&nbsp;reputations is to adopt a supply-and-demand framework. “Demand” here denotes&nbsp;the extent to which third parties will be interested in reading what the legal&nbsp;system has to say about the litigants’ behaviors. Many types of legal disputes&nbsp;interest only the disputants themselves. Classic examples come from family law&nbsp;or torts committed by individuals. Demand for reputation-relevant information in&nbsp;such cases will be low.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">“Supply” denotes the extent to which the legal system can actually produce quality information for third parties who are interested. We can envision a&nbsp;scenario such as medical malpractice litigation, where the demand is high, yet&nbsp;supply is low. On one hand, the reputation of caregivers is very important to&nbsp;third parties and hard for them to assess. So the interest in hearing what the legal&nbsp;system has to say will be high. On the other hand, medical malpractice disputes&nbsp;- when they do not settle - are being decided by inexpert jurors who do not&nbsp;produce detailed opinions. The legal system thus supplies little meaningful&nbsp;reputation information.<sup>99</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The legal system meaningfully impacts reputational sanctions only in areas with both high demand and good supply, namely, areas where market players are&nbsp;constantly looking to reevaluate their beliefs, and the legal institutions are&nbsp;perceived as a capable and credible source of information. One example of an&nbsp;area where both supply-and-demand conditions are met is corporate and&nbsp;securities laws. Stakeholders who deal with large publicly traded companies&nbsp;have ample reason to continuously look for new information and interpretation&nbsp;on companies’ abilities and intentions, given the high stakes and various&nbsp;asymmetric information problems involved. And the players in the market -private intermediaries such as securities analysts or institutional investors -enjoy enough sophistication and resources to mine legal proceedings for second&nbsp;opinions. Generally speaking, demand for reputation-relevant information on&nbsp;publicly traded companies is high simply because players in the market are more&nbsp;interested in the empirical truth and the de-biasing of information than&nbsp;consumers of news in other contexts.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">On the supply side, several factors make the main adjudicators of corporate behavior - Delaware courts - well positioned to provide timely, comprehensible,&nbsp;and thorough reputation information. First, they are respected in legal and&nbsp;business communities.— The nonpolitical appointment process (Delaware&nbsp;judges frequently come from the bar) and the specialized docket allow judges to&nbsp;develop expertise and a broad perspective on market norms. Second, they&nbsp;manage to avoid the time lag that usually accompanies litigation: the specialized&nbsp;and small docket also enables Delaware judges to adjudicate disputes relatively&nbsp;quickly, producing information in a timely manner.— Third, as </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 3&nbsp;</span><span class="font21">elaborates, Delaware’s decisional law has developed in ways that encourage&nbsp;information production. For example, the use of open-ended legal standards,&nbsp;such as the good-faith doctrine,— allows plaintiffs to survive motions to dismiss&nbsp;and reach discovery, and gives judges more flexibility to tailor their own&nbsp;narrative of the events. Finally, the legal system is more likely to tell market&nbsp;players something they do not already know when the issue at hand concerns&nbsp;questions like what insiders knew and when they knew it. Corporate law&nbsp;litigation usually provides valuable answers to these questions, as it revolves&nbsp;around questions of management integrity and the quality of checks and&nbsp;balances throughout the hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The evidence from my law-as-source study corroborate this supply-and-demand framework: the law indeed plays a bigger role in facilitating media scrutiny of private businesses than it does in other areas. The </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">next section&nbsp;</span><span class="font21">elaborates.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark364"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark365"></a>2.5.5 Evidence: Where Is Legal Sourcing More/Less Likely?</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Section 2.3</span><span class="font21"> introduced evidence that information coming from the legal system plays an important role in sourcing investigative reporting. This section moves&nbsp;from the “on average” claims to the cross-sectional variation: what did the&nbsp;content analysis, interviews, tip sheets, and syllabi tell us about the areas in&nbsp;which law-as-source dynamics are more or less pronounced? Two types of&nbsp;misbehavior stand out: (1) in misbehavior where the victims have little recourse&nbsp;to the legal system (for various reasons), the law-as-source dynamics apply less&nbsp;forcefully; (2) when the misbehaving entity is not a government agency but&nbsp;rather a private company, the law-as-source dynamics apply more forcefully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Think first about the category of victims without recourse. The law cannot generate reputational deterrence when the misbehavior in question does not&nbsp;reach the legal system. Certain conditions make victims less likely to file&nbsp;lawsuits and regulators less likely to start investigations, thereby limiting the&nbsp;relevance of legal sourcing. One subset of cases concerns </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">victims in foreign&nbsp;countries,</span><span class="font21"> who do not enjoy the same right of access to courts (or power to&nbsp;extract information from the other side once in courts) as Americans do.<sup>104</sup> A&nbsp;second subset of cases concerns </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">victims who are poor</span><span class="font21"> and do not have the&nbsp;resources needed to set the legal system in motion.— Substandard housing&nbsp;problems are a case in point.— Finally, a big subset of cases concerns scenarios&nbsp;in which the costs of misconduct are </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">dispersed</span><span class="font21"> among multiple victims, or are so&nbsp;</span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">opaque</span><span class="font21"> that the victims are unaware of the misconduct.<sup>107</sup> In such contexts, even&nbsp;if the victims are not marginalized in society and can theoretically fight back,&nbsp;they lack the information needed to wage a legal battle, thereby making it less&nbsp;likely that the media will scrutinize the misconduct in question. Take for&nbsp;example the case of DuPont’s emissions of a toxic chemical used in the process&nbsp;of manufacturing Teflon at its plant in West Virgínia.— Residents from&nbsp;neighboring communities had the toxic chemical in their drinking water and&nbsp;suffered increased incidences of various diseases, but could not file a lawsuit&nbsp;simply because they did not know that such a chemical existed in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">From a social planner perspective, areas where both watchdogs - the media and the courts - are likely to fail are ones that bear monitoring. Presumably, in&nbsp;contexts where victims lack recourse to the legal system, we would want another&nbsp;system of control - another watchdog - to step in and spotlight the victims’&nbsp;plight. Yet reputational control depends on media coverage - and the media’s&nbsp;reliance on law as source means that exactly in such contexts the media is less&nbsp;likely to facilitate reputational control.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The second dynamic to consider is the difference between public and private entities. Many of my interviewees suggested that law-as-source dynamics&nbsp;play an especially important role in business investigative journalism.— The&nbsp;interviews corroborated a notion that reverberates in communication studies:&nbsp;holding big business accountable is actually much tougher than holding big&nbsp;government accountable.— The reason for this has a lot to do with sourcing: my&nbsp;interviewees mentioned three types of sources of damning information that are&nbsp;more available on government misconduct than they are on business misconduct:&nbsp;information from </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">rivals,</span><span class="font21"> information from </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">insiders,</span><span class="font21"> and publicly available&nbsp;</span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">records.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">First, a journalist looking for information on misbehavior by politicians can usually count on the politician’s rivals. Politics is often a zero-sum game, and&nbsp;politicians are quick to point out their rivals’ flaws and misconduct to the&nbsp;media.<sup>111</sup> Within the business world, by contrast, tips by rivals are much harder&nbsp;to come by.<sup>112</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Second, my interviewees suggested that government insiders are more likely to blow the whistle than their corporate counterparts are.<sup>113</sup> The reason,&nbsp;they conjecture, lies in the different organizational cultures: people in&nbsp;government have a greater sense of public duty, and so they are more likely to&nbsp;approach the media when observing misconduct by their superiors.— Insiders in&nbsp;private business, by contrast, tend to adopt a profit-maximizing mindset and&nbsp;“zealously guard documents.”<sup>115</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Finally, direct sourcing tools help with information on government more than with information on private business.<sup>116</sup> A journalist cannot file FOIA&nbsp;requests or rely on open records laws to get information on how companies&nbsp;behave, and the companies tend not to volunteer damning information.<sup>117</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The added difficulty of getting information on big businesses figures to increase the demand for indirect sourcing channels, such as law enforcement&nbsp;actions.— And the supply tends to meet the high demand: big businesses are&nbsp;almost always involved in one legal dispute or another. As a 2017 study shows,&nbsp;more than half of all US companies are managing at least one class action&nbsp;against them at any given point in time.<sup>119</sup> It is therefore not surprising that&nbsp;virtually every investigative journalism tip sheet or course syllabus mentions&nbsp;court documents as key for investigating business. In the words of the Dean of&nbsp;Columbia Journalism School: “[when I teach students] the first thing on the&nbsp;slides is: litigation ... there’s hardly a company in this world that is not being&nbsp;sued, and this is where you get a window [into what is going on in the&nbsp;company].”<sup>120</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">My content analysis of prizewinning investigative projects lends credence to the journalists’ perspective I picked up from interviews, tip sheets, and&nbsp;syllabi. Six of the twenty-five Pulitzer-winning projects in my sample focus on&nbsp;holding private companies to account.<sup>121</sup> Five of them rely strongly on litigation&nbsp;or regulatory investigations. In an attempt to dig further into the specific context&nbsp;of business investigative journalism, I looked beyond Pulitzers to the Loeb&nbsp;awards, considered the premier prize for business journalism. Among the Loeb&nbsp;awards, I looked at investigative projects that targeted a specific firm. Three&nbsp;examples stood out: the 2017 project on Allegiant Air, showing the alarming rate&nbsp;of airplane malfunctions in the low-cost carrier’s fleet; the 2010 project on&nbsp;Toyota, investigating complaints of unintended sudden acceleration; and the&nbsp;2004 project on Boeing, detailing corporate espionage against rival Lockheed&nbsp;Martin. Unsurprisingly, it turned out that all three projects rested heavily on&nbsp;legal sources.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">When Boeing tried to attain proprietary Lockheed Martin documents, Lockheed sued, and the Justice Department and the US Attorney’s Office in Los&nbsp;Angeles got involved as well. The reporters could then rely on legal documents&nbsp;to include detail, and showed that the espionage was not merely the doing of&nbsp;rogue low-level employees, as Boeing claimed.— The reporters in the Toyota&nbsp;story reviewed thousands of regulatory investigation and incidence reports.&nbsp;These regulatory reports allowed the reporters to benchmark the gravity and&nbsp;frequency of sudden acceleration issues with Toyota against the industry:&nbsp;nineteen fatalities in Toyotas, eleven in all other cars combined.— The legal&nbsp;documents were therefore crucial in establishing the storyline and clarifying that&nbsp;the accidents were not just one-off random mistakes, contrary to what the&nbsp;company and the regulators claimed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">We observed a similar pattern of relying on regulatory reports at the Allegiant Air story: the reporters there submitted a FOIA request to get the&nbsp;mechanical malfunction reports that were filed with the aviation regulator. They&nbsp;used the data to benchmark the company’s midair malfunctions against the&nbsp;industry, thus establishing the impetus for the project, namely, “[a]ll major&nbsp;airlines break down once in a while. But none of them break down in midair&nbsp;more often than Allegiant.”<sup>124</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Armed with a more nuanced version of the law and reputation argument, we can now start applying it to specific legal contexts, starting with where the&nbsp;reputational effects are apparently strongest: corporate law.</span></p>

It is better than no signal, though.&nbsp;Fly-by-night watchdogs are not able to boast a long list of legal success&nbsp;stories.</span></p></li><li>

Hamilton examines the societal changes that the most successful&nbsp;investigative projects - those submitted to journalistic award competitions -bring about. To illustrate, consider one case: a 1998 Pulitzer-winning&nbsp;investigation by the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Washington Post,</span><span class="font21"> which found that DC police officers&nbsp;were shooting and killing civilians at an alarming rate. The </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">PosLs&nbsp;</span><span class="font21">investigative series brought immediate changes in how DC police use force.&nbsp;As a result, fatal shootings by police officers dropped dramatically from 1999&nbsp;onwards. Hamilton puts a number on the benefits from reduced fatalities,&nbsp;using “value of statistical life” measurements. His calculation suggests an&nbsp;estimated $70 million in net social benefits from the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Post</span><span class="font21"> investigation.</span></p></li><li>

<p><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Corporate Law 's Puzzle</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark488"></a>3.1 Introduction</span></h4>
<p><span class="font21">How does corporate law work? This question has puzzled corporate legal scholarship for decades. The puzzle stems from the apparent lack of legal&nbsp;sanctions. Corporate decision makers practically never pay out of pocket for&nbsp;their misbehavior,<sup>1</sup> so presumably the law lacks teeth. An influential strand of&nbsp;the literature suggested that corporate law’s teeth consist in facilitating </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">nonlegal&nbsp;</span><span class="font21">sanctions. But so far the existing accounts have failed to develop a satisfactory&nbsp;theory of how nonlegal forces work or how exactly the law facilitates them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">This makes corporate law the classic context in which to start applying the reputation-through-litigation theory. Scholars widely agree that in this context&nbsp;reputation matters. They even recognize that the law affects behavior not just&nbsp;through legal sanctions, but also by facilitating nonlegal sanctions. All that is&nbsp;needed is fine-tuning and some empirical work: existing accounts focus on how&nbsp;corporate law affects morals (tells market players how they ought to behave),&nbsp;and do not examine how information from the courtroom travels to the court of&nbsp;public opinion. This chapter, by contrast, focuses on how corporate law affects&nbsp;reputation (tells market players how others actually behaved), and examine&nbsp;media coverage of fiduciary duty litigation. To concretize the argument, the&nbsp;chapter hones in on the famous corporate law case of </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Disney.</span><span class="font21"> Applying the&nbsp;reputational perspective to corporate law produces a set of fresh insights on&nbsp;longstanding debates, such as the role of indeterminacy and open standards, or&nbsp;how to assess director liability (individually or collectively).</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The chapter proceeds in four sections. </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Section 3.2</span><span class="font21"> describes the existing approach to corporate law’s impact on nonlegal sanctions. Current accounts&nbsp;focus on how judicial comments induce guilty feelings among misbehaving&nbsp;directors or on social shaming among misbehaving directors’ peers. In other&nbsp;words, the current approach deals narrowly with how </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">verdicts</span><span class="font21"> ramp up the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">moral&nbsp;</span><span class="font21">sanctions for misbehaving. In reality, though, verdicts are rare, and the moral&nbsp;rebukes offered in them seldom reach their presumed audiences. It therefore&nbsp;makes sense to shift our focus to how the litigation process as a whole (not just&nbsp;verdicts) shapes the reputational (not just moral) sanctions for misbehaving. The&nbsp;section then outlines three important factors that determine how information&nbsp;from the courtroom translates into the court of public opinion. A key takeaway&nbsp;point is that, counterintuitively, not every case of judicial scolding hurts the&nbsp;company’s reputation. To predict the reputational impact, we need to ask who&nbsp;the judge is scolding (an ousted individual or an unhealthy corporate culture?);&nbsp;what she is scolding for (honest incompetence or calculated disregard for&nbsp;shareholder interests?); and what her scolding adds to the preexisting&nbsp;information environment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Section 3.3</span><span class="font21"> employs the famous </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Disney</span><span class="font21"> litigation as a case study, analyzing how media coverage of the debacle in question changed before, during, and after&nbsp;litigation. </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Section 3.4</span><span class="font21"> uses the reputational perspective to reevaluate key&nbsp;corporate law doctrines. </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Section 3.5</span><span class="font21"> applies the reputational perspective to the&nbsp;regulatory competition debate, explaining why Delaware law facilitates better&nbsp;information flows than other state corporate laws, and why getting scorned by&nbsp;Delaware judges may actually be good for corporate America.</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark489"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">3.2 How Fiduciary Duty Litigation Affects&nbsp;Nonlegal Sanctions: “Saints and Sinners”&nbsp;Revisited</span></p></li></ul>
<h5><a name="bookmark490"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark491"></a>3.2.1 The Existing Approach: Saints and Sinners</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">Delaware fiduciary duty litigation features a striking pattern: no sanctioning but lots of talking. Delaware judges usually refrain from imposing legal sanctions on&nbsp;company decision makers, but they do not shy away from criticizing the&nbsp;directors’ behavior whenever they see fit.<sup>2</sup> This fact pattern of lengthy, fact-intensive, judgmental verdicts raises a puzzle: what is the point in preaching if&nbsp;you are not going to sanction? If Delaware courts are not enforcing fiduciary&nbsp;duties, why do they bother talking about them so much?</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Several prominent corporate legal scholars suggest a solution to this puzzle: preaching </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">is</span><span class="font21"> the point, they claim. Preaching is not an afterthought but rather the&nbsp;main function of Delaware decisional law. It is through richly detailed narratives&nbsp;of good and bad corporate behavior that Delaware judges control corporate&nbsp;behavior.<sup>3</sup> Once the morality tales of corporate saints and sinners become&nbsp;publicly available, they unleash all sorts of nonlegal forces. In one version of&nbsp;this “saints and sinners” approach to corporate law, directors hate being dressed&nbsp;down in verdicts because it reduces the esteem that they get from colleagues and&nbsp;peers (“external moral sanctions”).<sup>4</sup> In another version, directors who are subject&nbsp;to judicial scolding suffer not from disesteem of others but rather from their own&nbsp;sense of guilt (“internal moral sanctions”).<sup>5</sup> And because judges elicit the&nbsp;opprobrium of third parties and/or guilt feelings of first parties simply by what&nbsp;they say, they get to sanction and deter misbehavior without imposing legal&nbsp;sanctions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">This saints-and-sinners theory of corporate law does a great job of spotlighting one indirect deterrence element of corporate law. It correctly directs&nbsp;our attention to the possibility that corporate litigation shapes behavior not just&nbsp;through the outcomes but also through the content of judicial opinions. But as&nbsp;the following paragraphs explain, the existing approach has too narrow a focus. I&nbsp;propose here a shift in perspective: from focusing just on how judicial comments&nbsp;affect moral judgments<sup>6</sup> to focusing on how the litigation process as a whole&nbsp;affects reputational judgments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">First, focusing just on judicial opinions is problematic because most legal disputes settle. Judges get very few chances to offer moral rebukes in verdicts.<sup>7&nbsp;</sup>Cases that settle do not produce moralistic impact, but they may nevertheless&nbsp;affect the market reaction: not by shaping moral beliefs but rather by shaping&nbsp;factual beliefs. The process itself prior to settlements (pleading, discovery, and&nbsp;trial) sheds light on reputation-relevant information. Indeed, </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 2</span><span class="font21"> showed&nbsp;that market players monitor and react to events during the early stages of the&nbsp;process.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Second, focusing just on moralistic impact is problematic because the typical verdict sends mixed messages: by legally exonerating defendants, the&nbsp;verdict dilutes the power of any moralistic condemnations made in dicta. The&nbsp;magnitude of legal sanctions embodies the blameworthiness of behavior.<sup>8&nbsp;</sup>Directors are less likely to suffer guilt, and third parties are less likely to engage&nbsp;in shaming, when the legal system tells them that the behavior in question is not&nbsp;bad enough to merit legal sanctioning. Reputational sanctions, by contrast, are&nbsp;less strongly correlated with legal sanctions. As </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 2</span><span class="font21"> showed, the trial’s&nbsp;outcome is based on specific legal doctrines that may not be relevant to&nbsp;reputational evaluations. The legal outcome is usually determined from a&nbsp;backward-looking perspective, while a reputational outcome is usually&nbsp;determined from a forward-looking perspective (how indicative of future&nbsp;behavior the adverse action is). As a result, the correlation between legal and&nbsp;reputational outcomes is very imperfect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Finally, moral rebukes often get lost in translation. Directors normally do not read judicial opinions. And the lawyers who summarize the verdicts for&nbsp;directors usually screen out the caustic comments in their memos to their&nbsp;clients.</span><span class="font16">9 </span><span class="font21">The rebukes rarely reach their presumed audiences. The power of moral&nbsp;rebukes to propel individuals to engage in costly punishing depends largely on&nbsp;striking the right tone and tenor - factors that easily get lost in translation.&nbsp;Reputational information, by contrast, is less sensitive to distorted transmission.&nbsp;Reputational sanctioning is an exercise in self-interest, and sophisticated&nbsp;investors do not wait for someone to strike the right tone and propel them to act.&nbsp;They stand to gain from proactively mining litigation for hard information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">These three problems - lack of opinions, sanctions, and communication channels - illustrate why it makes sense to focus on reputational rather than&nbsp;moralistic impact. The </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">next section</span><span class="font21"> proceeds to explain </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">how</span><span class="font21"> we should focus on&nbsp;reputational impact: highlighting the main factors that determine how&nbsp;information from fiduciary duty litigation translates into changes in the&nbsp;reputations of the parties to the dispute.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark492"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark493"></a>3.2.2 The Reputational Effects of Judicial Scolding</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">As </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 2</span><span class="font21"> showed, we cannot simply assume that litigation would hurt the reputation of the companies and the businesspeople involved. Reputational&nbsp;sanctions work in fuzzy ways that do not lend themselves to generalizations.&nbsp;With fiduciary duty litigation specifically, when trying to predict the reputational&nbsp;outcomes of a given dispute, we should ask three questions: “scolding who?”&nbsp;“Scolding compared to what?” and “scolding for what?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">First, the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">“scolding who”</span><span class="font21"> question. To recast our discussion in </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 2</span><span class="font21">, sometimes there can be a difference between litigation’s effects on individual&nbsp;reputation and organizational reputation. Nowhere is this difference more&nbsp;pronounced than in the context of corporate law litigation, where many disputes&nbsp;are brought as derivative suits. Derivative suits are brought in the name of the&nbsp;company against its managers, and thereby generate information on actions done&nbsp;by managers, supposedly against the company. Such litigation often leads to one&nbsp;of two scenarios with completely different reputational ramifications: either the&nbsp;judge criticizes singled-out individuals (thereby hurting the individuals’&nbsp;reputation), or the judge criticizes the company’s systemic failures (thereby&nbsp;hurting the company’s reputation).</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Second, the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">“scolding compared to what?”</span><span class="font21"> question. Corporate law litigation often involves big and visible companies, and comes against the&nbsp;background of an already existing market reaction. When the company is&nbsp;publicly traded, stock analysts, institutional investors, and business media have&nbsp;incentives to quickly find out the facts about what happened and offer&nbsp;interpretations about how it happened.<sup>10</sup> As a result, in many of the cases that&nbsp;make it to court, the defendant-company stakeholders have already learned about&nbsp;the misbehavior and formed opinions. In fact, many lawsuits are filed precisely&nbsp;because the stock market learned about the bad news and dropped the stock&nbsp;price, causing plaintiff lawyers to rush to file a lawsuit. A reputational analysis&nbsp;of litigation therefore should concentrate on relative impact: do not ask whether&nbsp;the judge’s version is unfavorable to the company - ask whether it is more or&nbsp;less favorable than the prevalent version accepted in the market prior to&nbsp;litigation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Finally, we should ask </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">“scolding for what?”</span><span class="font21"> as </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 1</span><span class="font21"> showed, the type of sin committed affects the reputational outcome. Judicial comments will affect&nbsp;stakeholder attributions; that is, whether stakeholders attribute the bad outcomes&nbsp;to honest incompetence or to calculated disregard for market norms. Here one&nbsp;counterintuitive observation is especially intriguing: the judge’s version, even&nbsp;when containing caustic criticism, typically supports a framing that is relatively&nbsp;favorable to the company. The preexisting framing is tilted by market and social&nbsp;arbiters’ incentives to pile on criticism once bad news breaks, and the allegation-driven media’s incentives to highlight soundbites from the plaintiffs’ lawyers&nbsp;post-filing.<sup>11</sup> As a result, the preexisting version usually makes even caustic&nbsp;judicial comments seem nuanced when compared to the baseline.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Therein lies the rub in the saints-and-sinners approach: people are not exclusively saints or sinners, and judges know that. According to the saints-and-sinners argument, the judges’ role is to help market players realize that certain&nbsp;defendants are sinners. But in reality the order and roles are reversed: the market&nbsp;reacts first by painting accused businessmen in black. And the judge often&nbsp;repaints a more richly detailed picture in shades of gray. The court of public&nbsp;opinion tends to categorize businessmen/companies as complete heroes or&nbsp;complete villains. And judges’ interpretations - even when critical of defendants&nbsp;- tend to be more contextual. Accordingly, the relative effect of judicial&nbsp;comments on reputation is not necessarily negative, and sometimes even&nbsp;positive. For the judge’s narrative to affect the company’s reputation positively it&nbsp;does not have to be a resounding endorsement of the defendants’ behavior. It&nbsp;only has to make the bad situation appear less bad, for example, by showing that&nbsp;the adverse action does not reflect the company’s operational philosophy.<sup>12</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">To concretize these differences between the saints-and-sinners approach and the reputational approach, let us now delve into the specific case of </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Disney.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark494"></a>3.3 The </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Disney</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> Litigation: a Case Study</span></h4>
<p><span class="font21">The </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Disney</span><span class="font21"> litigation is one of the most anticipated and discussed corporate law cases in decades.— It revolved around the hiring and subsequent firing of&nbsp;Hollywood’s agent Michael Ovitz as Disney’s president. Ovitz failed to perform&nbsp;satisfactorily and was fired after a year, but not before collecting a $140-million&nbsp;termination package from Disney. Disney’s shareholders sued the directors for&nbsp;breaching their fiduciary duties in supervising the hiring and firing of Ovitz.<sup>14&nbsp;</sup>After a lengthy battle at the pleading stage, the lawsuit proceeded to a full-fledged trial. Chancellor Chandler then delivered a 170-page fact-intensive&nbsp;decision that was filled with caustic criticism but ultimately exonerated the&nbsp;defendants who walked away winning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Many corporate legal scholars have since hailed the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Disney</span><span class="font21"> decision as a paradigmatic example of the saints-and-sinners approach: as illustrating how&nbsp;Delaware courts avoid legal sanctions while ramping up nonlegal sanctions, as&nbsp;exonerating while condemning.<sup>15</sup> And this is exactly what makes </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Disney</span><span class="font21"> such an&nbsp;interesting case study for our purposes; a deeper look reveals that even this&nbsp;seemingly clear-cut example does not follow the saints-and-sinners theory’s&nbsp;predictions.<sup>16</sup> Instead, it corroborates the alternative theory presented here. The&nbsp;</span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Disney</span><span class="font21"> saga illustrates the reputational dynamics of big-case litigation: the&nbsp;verdict does not add new information because almost every fact cited by the&nbsp;Chancellor had already been covered by the media. </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Disney</span><span class="font21"> also illustrates how a&nbsp;seemingly caustic verdict when read in isolation is actually favorable to the&nbsp;company when considering our three key factors: the preexisting information,&nbsp;who the judge is scolding, and what he is scolding them for.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">What distinguishes my reading of </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Disney</span><span class="font21"> from the numerous previous dissections of the case is the focus on relative nonlegal impact. Many scholars&nbsp;have focused on doctrinal analysis but ignored the decision’s nonlegal impact.&nbsp;The scholars who have touched on the nonlegal impact simply note the&nbsp;decision’s moralistic tone and assume that it ramps up the nonlegal sanctions and&nbsp;deterrence. I adopt a different methodology that shifts our focus to the dynamics&nbsp;of reputational sanctions. Using a content analysis of the media coverage of the&nbsp;Ovitz debacle, I explore how the reputational capital of Disney and its top&nbsp;managers fluctuated before, during, and after litigation. The media coverage&nbsp;analysis, supplemented with insights from my interviews with key players,<sup>17&nbsp;</sup>allows us to decipher the relative reputational impact of litigation. In other&nbsp;words, by examining how the court of public opinion treated the Ovitz affair&nbsp;before the verdict, we can tease out the real difference that the verdict made as a&nbsp;second opinion.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark495"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark496"></a>3.3.1 Information Produced before Litigation Started</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">The </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Disney</span><span class="font21"> lawsuit was filed in 1997. But by that time the court of public opinion had already been in session for a year. And the company was losing,&nbsp;badly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The media covered the Disney-Ovitz debacle extensively during 1996. Investigative journalists were the first to uncover the problems with Disney’s&nbsp;management. One lead story followed another, and by the second half of 1996,&nbsp;each medium was competing to come up with vivid details about the bad blood&nbsp;between Disney’s top managers.— The early reports highlighted how Disney’s&nbsp;number one (Michael Eisner) ran his own show without checks and balances&nbsp;from the board— while Disney’s new number two (Ovitz) was in over his head.—&nbsp;At the time, the company was denying the stories in an attempt to limit their&nbsp;negative reputational impact. But the denials rang hollow when investigative&nbsp;reporters exposed internal documents (such as Eisner’s internal memos&nbsp;tarnishing Ovitz) and quotes from former insiders going on record about&nbsp;Disney’s governance flaws.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Then in late 1996 the company could no longer deny the problems. Ovitz was fired, and the company had to file press releases and submit information to&nbsp;the SEC (in our lingo: direct legal sources). The injection of new information&nbsp;intensified the market reaction. It was then - via the company’s own reporting -that the public learned about the hefty severance package awarded to Ovitz after&nbsp;an unsatisfactory year at the helm. Now market and social arbiters were&nbsp;competing over who would offer stronger condemnations of Disney. Large&nbsp;institutional investors claimed to be enraged.<sup>22</sup> The president of the National&nbsp;Association of Corporate Directors said that Disney’s board was “living in the&nbsp;dark ages” and was too beholden to Eisner.<sup>23</sup> And practically all the major&nbsp;newspapers ran editoriais that attributed the Ovitz debacle to a corporate culture&nbsp;of total disregard for shareholder interests and societal norms.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Overall, the media coverage of the Ovitz debacle was extensive in scope and unfavorable in tone from the get-go. Any stakeholder of Disney had the&nbsp;chance to learn about the problems and downgrade her beliefs about the&nbsp;company’s management integrity, before a lawsuit was even filed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Corporate legal scholars treat the 2005 verdict as setting a reputational sanction in motion.— But in reality the reputational system was already in&nbsp;motion in 1996. Those involved in the Ovitz debacle suffered a huge initial&nbsp;reputational hit. Before litigation began, the company was already depicted as&nbsp;the poster child for bad corporate governance, and its top managers were&nbsp;ridiculed.— In fact, it was the reputational system that set the legal system in&nbsp;motion: the lawyers based their 1997 complaint on facts and interpretations&nbsp;taken straight from the media coverage.<sup>27</sup></span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark497"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark498"></a>3.3.2 Information Produced during the Earlier Stages in Litigation</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">Once a complaint was filed, the mere process of litigation (pleading, discovery, and trial) affected Disney’s reputation. The media coverage of the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Disney&nbsp;</span><span class="font21">litigation was not limited to the final verdict: it was in full effect in the discovery&nbsp;and trial stages, voluminous in scope and unfavorable in tone. It impacted the&nbsp;defendants’ reputation at least as much as the verdict did.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The first question to consider is </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">what</span><span class="font21"> information was covered. The answer: almost everything. After the complaint finally passed the motion to dismiss stage&nbsp;in 2003, the media turned their attention back to the Ovitz debacle. Major&nbsp;financial newspapers sent designated reporters to Delaware to report daily from&nbsp;the trial. And almost any meaningful tidbit of information submitted to court -such as plaintiffs’ experts’ reports or internal documents revealed in discovery -found its way to mass media and was quickly and widely diffused.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The second question to consider is </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">how</span><span class="font21"> information was covered by the press. The answer: negatively. The media used the information produced during&nbsp;litigation to paint an unfavorable picture of the company’s corporate governance&nbsp;and the individual directors’ competence and integrity. Media reporters&nbsp;spotlighted three themes in particular. First, reporters painted a picture of&nbsp;disregard for “best practices of corporate governance” at Disney.<sup>29</sup> They&nbsp;highlighted multiple descriptions of how Eisner was an imperialist who did not&nbsp;consult the board enough and how board members failed to do their jobs&nbsp;confronting Eisner. A notable example comes from the new revelation (through&nbsp;cross-examinations) that Disney’s hiring committee did not even convene before&nbsp;Ovitz’s hiring was announced.— Second, reporters emphasized how Ovitz was&nbsp;incompetent for the job he was hired to do. The media especially enjoyed&nbsp;covering the juicy details from plaintiffs’ experts’ testimonies suggesting that</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Ovitz was a habitual liar and a conspicuous spender.— Finally, reporters suggested that the mismatch and eventual breakup with Ovitz could have been&nbsp;anticipated and avoided. Ovitz himself testified that at the time of his hiring, he&nbsp;thought that the “duty of care” applied only to hospitals.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Overall, the onslaught of information substantiated the market’s initial (predominantly negative) reaction. The themes highlighted by the media were&nbsp;not new per se. The public knew the main plotlines - the bad blood, Eisner’s&nbsp;power-tripping, and Ovitz’s powerlessness - before litigation even started. Still,&nbsp;the litigation process added lots of small details and filled in the blank parts of&nbsp;the story.— Most importantly, even when litigation did not produce new&nbsp;information, it nevertheless raised the saliency of and removed uncertainty from&nbsp;existing information. Litigation kept the Disney-Ovitz story in the news cycle,&nbsp;recalling the public’s attention to it.<sup>34</sup> And it made certain versions of the story&nbsp;more credible and less refutable by giving the public access to direct quotes and&nbsp;internal memos from Disney insiders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The Disney case study thus illustrates how the informational role of litigation is not limited to the final outcomes (i.e., not limited to verdicts or&nbsp;settlement announcements). To the extent that the legal system had something to&nbsp;add to market players’ assessments of Disney, the additions came largely from&nbsp;the process rather than the verdict. As an anecdote: in Michael Ovitz’s </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Wikipedia&nbsp;</span><span class="font21">webpage, the description of the Disney debacle relies not on quotes from the&nbsp;2005 verdict, but rather on a 2004 media story covering the depositions.— To&nbsp;me, this anecdote indicates how the process itself often makes a lasting&nbsp;reputational impact, regardless of the verdict.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark499"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark500"></a>3.3.3 The Real Impact of the Verdict</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">Recognizing the important informational role of the process pushes us to rethink the role of verdicts. Judges base their interpretations on information gleaned&nbsp;from discovery, testimonies, and experts’ reports. In cases with big-firm&nbsp;defendants, such as </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Disney,</span><span class="font21"> the same information that the judge relies upon often&nbsp;gets diffused immediately. By the time the judge releases her version, the public&nbsp;is already aware of the information contained in it. Verdicts in big cases thus&nbsp;fulfill a different informational role than previously assumed: they affect&nbsp;reputational sanctions not by providing new information but rather by&nbsp;constructing and disseminating existing information. Here again, the deep dive&nbsp;into the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Disney</span><span class="font21"> affair provides a case in point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">To analyze the impact that the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Disney</span><span class="font21"> verdict had, we have to first appreciate how the court of public opinion treated the Ovitz affair prior to the&nbsp;verdict. Rereading the decision along with the media coverage of it generates&nbsp;one immediate conclusion: the conventional view that sees the verdict as a&nbsp;reputational deathblow to everyone involved is misguided. Granted, Chancellor&nbsp;Chandler’s version contains some quotable caustic comments. But it also&nbsp;provides more nuanced and contextual explanations for the Ovitz debacle.&nbsp;Unlike the prevalent preexisting interpretations of what went wrong in Disney,&nbsp;the verdict attributes the bad outcome to rare external conditions rather than to&nbsp;deep-rooted disregard for market norms. And the Chancellor reserves his&nbsp;strongest criticisms for individuals who were already ousted from Disney, thus&nbsp;implicitly creating a separation between bad (ousted) individuals and a good&nbsp;company. As a result, to the extent that the verdict changed stakeholders’ beliefs,&nbsp;it probably pushed stakeholders into thinking more positively about the company&nbsp;and its incumbent management, by (1) emphasizing context; (2) scolding for&nbsp;transient, fixable mistakes; (3) and scolding individuais who were not a part of&nbsp;the company going forward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Emphasizing Context</span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">.</span><span class="font21"> The Chancellor opens his version with an explanation of the hiring: why Disney’s board rushed to hire someone with no&nbsp;experience in running a large public company, and then on top of that, signed an&nbsp;outrageous severance package provision. Here the verdict’s version differs from&nbsp;preexisting versions by putting more emphasis on the context. The Chancellor&nbsp;highlights from the outset (and then reiterates constantly)— the “perfect storm”&nbsp;that pushed Disney into the Ovitz affair: Disney’s previous president died in a&nbsp;helicopter crash; Disney’s CEO (Eisner) suffered from a heart condition; and the&nbsp;company was in the midst of major expansions. Due to these unusual&nbsp;circumstances, the company desperately needed a new president to take the&nbsp;burden off the ailing Eisner in the immediate term and to provide an insurance&nbsp;and succession plan for the long run. Targeting Ovitz as the quick fix made&nbsp;sense at the time, since he was considered Hollywood’s number one power&nbsp;broker.— And promising Ovitz a hefty severance package was necessary in order&nbsp;to lure him from his previous lucrative position and away from Disney’s&nbsp;competitors who were courting him.<sup>38</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">By making the context more salient,<sup>39</sup> the verdict helps stakeholders overcome biases that plague their reputational assessments. Most notably, the&nbsp;Chancellor opens his decision by explicitly warning the readers from hindsight&nbsp;bias: do not ask yourself whether the board’s decisions make sense to you now,&nbsp;he tells the reader; ask whether they made sense at the time they were taken.—&nbsp;The Chancellor then provides the readers with tools to mitigate their hindsight&nbsp;bias: he extends the timeframe by spotlighting the events that preceded Ovitz’s&nbsp;hiring and reminds the reader not to evaluate Disney’s management integrity&nbsp;according to twenty-first-century best practices (which were not relevant when&nbsp;the Ovitz affair occurred).<sup>41</sup> Most notably, the Chancellor emphasizes that&nbsp;Disney’s stock prices jumped through the roof when Ovitz’s hiring was&nbsp;announced.— Amazingly enough, this important fact was largely missing from&nbsp;the preexisting accounts of the Ovitz affair in the media.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Emphasizing the context also mitigates readers’ tendency to adopt causal explanations (recall our earlier discussion of the naive psychologist bias). The&nbsp;pre-verdict narratives were predominantly causal: if Disney hired an&nbsp;incompetent president only to cushion his way out after a year with $140 million&nbsp;of shareholders’ money, then Disney’s decision makers must lack any regard for&nbsp;shareholders’ interests, right? Wrong, says the Chancellor. No one in Disney set&nbsp;out to hurt shareholders.<sup>43</sup> In fact, Disney decision makers - along with the rest&nbsp;of the world, as the stock price reaction indicates - thought that they were&nbsp;creating shareholder value by hiring Ovitz.<sup>44</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Scolding for Honest and Transient Mistakes</span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">.</span><span class="font19"> After explaining the hiring, </span><span class="font21">the Chancellor turns to explaining the firing. How come Ovitz performed&nbsp;miserably at Disney? Why was he not fired earlier? Most importantly, why was&nbsp;he not fired “for cause,” which could have saved the need to pay his severance&nbsp;package? Here, the Chancellor’s answers focus on “mismatch of cultures.” Ovitz&nbsp;and the incumbent managers wanted the experiment to work, the Chancellor tells&nbsp;us, but Ovitz simply experienced difficulties assimilating to Disney. Ovitz was&nbsp;flashy, conspicuous, and tried to “agent” his colleagues while the corporate&nbsp;culture was more blue collar and no-nonsense.<sup>45</sup> Corporate legal scholars viewed&nbsp;the Chancellor’s vivid descriptions of the mismatch as humiliating the&nbsp;defendants.<sup>46</sup> But such a view misses two important aspects of reputational&nbsp;sanctions: it ignores the baseline (how does the Chancellor’s version compare to&nbsp;preexisting ones?) and the distinction between individual- and organizational-level reputations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Attributing the failure to unanticipated mismatches and misperceptions is relatively favorable to the company’s reputation. Remember that most&nbsp;preexisting versions talked about how Ovitz’s failure was well anticipated:&nbsp;Disney’s incumbent management hired an obviously incompetent guy and then&nbsp;intentionally tripped that guy. Moreover, according to the preexisting versions,&nbsp;Ovitz was not fired for cause simply because Eisner wanted to protect his&nbsp;personal reputation at the expense of shareholder interests or, worse, because&nbsp;Eisner and Ovitz cynically plotted to transfer millions from shareholders’&nbsp;pockets to Ovitz’s.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The Chancellor rejects these versions: Ovitz actually made some positive contributions to the company, he tells us, and neither side was intentionally&nbsp;tripping or foreseeing the failure.<sup>48</sup> At one point the Chancellor describes in&nbsp;detail a seemingly irrelevant tidbit: a company meeting where all the top&nbsp;executives rode the company bus while Ovitz insisted on being chauffeured in&nbsp;his private limo. Legal scholars viewed the inclusion of such a gossipy story as&nbsp;tarnishing Ovitz’s reputation.<sup>49</sup> Well, maybe. But how does such a story affect&nbsp;the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">company’s</span><span class="font21"> reputation? For stakeholders thinking about whether to interact&nbsp;with Disney in the future, framing the debacle as a story about one greedy&nbsp;executive who did not fit in with the rest of the down-to-earth managers (and&nbsp;was subsequently fired) is not alarming; rather, it is assuring.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">To answer the “scolding for what” question: the Chancellor is scolding Disney and its directors not for calculated disregard for shareholder interests, but&nbsp;rather for honest, temporary mistakes. Prior to the verdict, market and social&nbsp;arbiters framed the Ovitz debacle as a clear-cut story of corporate villains:&nbsp;managers becoming too entrenched and greedy, losing regard for shareholder&nbsp;interests or societal norms. The verdict, however critical of Disney’s directors,&nbsp;tells a markedly different story: a story about making mistakes while pursuing&nbsp;shareholder value.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Scolding Individuals Who Were Already Ousted</span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">.</span><span class="font19"> Up to now I have </span><span class="font21">focused on how the verdict generates a more nuanced and favorable version. But&nbsp;there are specific parts in the verdict that cannot be viewed as favorable to the&nbsp;defendants’ reputation. The Chancellor scolded Eisner for disregarding corporate&nbsp;governance and scolded other top executives for not stepping up and raising red&nbsp;flags. His judicial scolding was done in such a catchable manner and came from&nbsp;such a credible source that it captured front pages of major newspapers,&nbsp;increasing public awareness and recalling attention to the defendants’ flaws.<sup>51&nbsp;</sup>But while the reputation-damaging effects of these comments were widely&nbsp;recognized, one aspect of them has been grossly overlooked: the identity of the&nbsp;targets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The Chancellor reserved his strongest criticism for six individuals. He laid most of the blame at Eisner’s feet— and then named three directors who should&nbsp;have done more to prevent the debacle: Irwin Russell, who did not negotiate&nbsp;hard enough on behalf of the company, and two members of the compensation&nbsp;committee - Ignacio Lozano and Sidney Poitier - for not being involved enough.&nbsp;The Chancellor also scolded two nondirectors: Sandy Litvack, the general&nbsp;counsel, for not informing the board on the possibility to avoid paying Ovitz his&nbsp;severance package; and Graef Crystal, an outside expert hired to help the&nbsp;compensation committee, for providing a faulty and incomplete report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">All of these six scolded businesspeople have one thing in common: </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">none of them were any longer an integral part of Disney when the verdict was issued.&nbsp;</span><span class="font21">The Disney 2005 board contained many directors who were part of the company&nbsp;in the Ovitz debacle days. Yet none of the retained individuals were scolded.&nbsp;The scolding was reserved for individuals who were already ousted or on their&nbsp;way out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Disney</span><span class="font21"> verdict thus illustrates how singling out individuals as sinners may actually help the company. Indeed, the media quickly picked up the&nbsp;scapegoating theme promoted by the verdict. The coverage of the verdict&nbsp;highlighted a contrast: a victory to Disney and its board and a blow to Eisner’s</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">scorecard on his way out of the company.<sup>53</sup> More generally, the verdict’s singling out of ousted individuals contributed to the company’s ability to&nbsp;convince stakeholders that the company had learned from its past and changed&nbsp;its ways. The media and institutional investors bought into the recovery&nbsp;message, presenting Disney as the perfect example of a corporate governance&nbsp;turnaround: the bad company of the 1990s turned into the role model of the&nbsp;2000s.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Aside from illustrating how the scolding of individuals does not necessarily translate into reputational damages to the company, </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Disney</span><span class="font21"> also generates a&nbsp;much more counterintuitive observation: judicial comments do not automatically&nbsp;translate into reputational damages to the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">individual</span><span class="font21"> either. The reputational&nbsp;outcomes to the individual depend, again, on the baseline and the type of sin for&nbsp;which the individual is scolded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">To illustrate, let us consider Chancellor Chandler’s treatment of Ovitz. The baseline - the pre-verdict reputational capital of Ovitz - was close to zero. When&nbsp;legal scholars claim that the verdict humiliated Ovitz by presenting him as a&nbsp;powerless whipping boy, they ignore the fact that these depictions were already&nbsp;publicly available and widely accepted in the court of public opinion.— The&nbsp;verdict could not have reduced Ovitz’s already deflated reputational capital by&nbsp;much (if at all). In fact, the Chancellor’s narrative resembles (and thus lends&nbsp;credence to) the narrative that Ovitz himself promoted in an attempt to recover&nbsp;his lost reputation.<sup>56</sup> Unsurprisingly so: it is better for Ovitz to be perceived as&nbsp;powerless or incompetent in a given task than as someone who cynically&nbsp;disregards shareholder interest or is inherently useless. As one </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Wall Street&nbsp;Journal</span><span class="font21"> columnist quipped: “if Mr. Ovitz does not come out smelling like a rose,&nbsp;he at least gets some of his reputation back.”—</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">*</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Overall, the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Disney</span><span class="font21"> litigation illustrates how judicial comments do not automatically translate into an increase in reputational sanctions. To the extent&nbsp;that the verdict impacted stakeholders’ beliefs, it probably convinced them that&nbsp;Disney’s problems are less deep-rooted and more easily fixable than they&nbsp;previously thought. This is not to suggest that the litigation was all fun and&nbsp;games for the defendants. In fact, it probably was a nightmare for them. After&nbsp;all, they were dragged through discovery and cross-examinations, and some of&nbsp;them were publicly scorned by the judge. But remember that from a reputational&nbsp;perspective, Disney and its managers took a lot of criticism for the Ovitz debacle&nbsp;prior to the verdict. Once the verdict got out, it actually silenced some critics by&nbsp;giving a more nuanced and contextual version, allowing the company to turn&nbsp;over a new leaf. And the parts of the verdict that fueled new criticism were&nbsp;directed at individuals who no longer were part of the incumbent management.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark501"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark502"></a>3.3.4 How Generalizable Are the Lessons from </span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Disney</span><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">?</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">Some may claim that we cannot extract general lessons from </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Disney</span><span class="font21"> because the case is so singular: no other corporate dispute would similarly capture the&nbsp;public’s attention. My response to this argument is twofold. First, remember that&nbsp;I use </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Disney</span><span class="font21"> to make a point about the state of current literature. Corporate legal&nbsp;scholars use </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Disney</span><span class="font21"> as a paradigmatic example of the saints-and-sinners&nbsp;approach, so it makes sense for me to engage them on their own terms. By&nbsp;showing that even this supposedly clear-cut case does not behave according to&nbsp;the existing theory’s predictions, I illustrate the need to adopt an alternative&nbsp;framework. For example, the saints-and-sinners proponents claim that in big-firm defendant cases, litigation ramps up nonlegal sanctions, and use </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Disney</span><span class="font21"> as a&nbsp;case in point.<sup>58</sup> But our deeper look into </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Disney</span><span class="font21"> suggests that it is exactly in&nbsp;these big and visible cases that the reputational dynamics may flip sides. A&nbsp;verdict may not play a role of informing market players about the bad corporate&nbsp;sinners, if only because the market has already learned about the misconduct and&nbsp;painted the company and businesspeople as sinners. Any theory of how litigation&nbsp;affects nonlegal sanction should therefore consider the pre-suit benchmark.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Second, and more fundamentally, </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Disney^s</span><span class="font21"> uniqueness is a matter of degree, not substance. Even though other large legal disputes are not as&nbsp;extensively debated in mass media as </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Disney</span><span class="font21"> was, many of them are&nbsp;nevertheless are tried in the court of public opinion, with the legal system&nbsp;relegated to a second-opinion role. To illustrate how the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Disney</span><span class="font21"> dynamics exist&nbsp;in other cases, consider another iconic corporate law case: </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Caremark.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The bad news that ignited the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Caremark</span><span class="font21"> litigation was the company’s failure to comply with healthcare regulations, specifically by paying “kickbacks”&nbsp;to physicians. Shareholders sued Caremark’s directors for breaching their&nbsp;fiduciary duty in not monitoring and stopping the illegalities. Like the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Disney&nbsp;</span><span class="font21">decision, Chancellor Allen’s decision in </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Caremark</span><span class="font21"> was seen by corporate legal&nbsp;scholars as a “saints and sinners” maneuver: avoiding legal sanctions while&nbsp;generating nonlegal sanctions.<sup>60</sup> But much like in </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Disney,</span><span class="font21"> a deeper analysis of&nbsp;the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Caremark</span><span class="font21"> saga reveals the same dynamics that resist the saints-and-sinners&nbsp;assumptions. First, the judicial opinion does not contain new information. By the&nbsp;time Chancellor Allen released his version, Caremark’ s stakeholders had already&nbsp;formed opinions about the kickbacks debacle and what it meant. The existing&nbsp;information environment was molded by social arbiters (“a spate of negative&nbsp;press”);— market arbiters (rating agencies lowering Caremark’s ratings);— and&nbsp;regulators (after the company pled guilty to several criminal counts, the&nbsp;government released a “statement of facts” detailing Caremark’s violations).<sup>63&nbsp;</sup>Similarly to </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Disney,</span><span class="font21"> parts of the legal complaint were actually based on&nbsp;information gathered from preexisting media coverage.<sup>64</sup> Chancellor Allen’s&nbsp;decision thus did not affect what information was available but rather mostly&nbsp;how available information was diffused. Again, the lesson is that analyses of big&nbsp;corporate legal disputes should adopt a second-opinion perspective, considering&nbsp;the baseline.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Second, in </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Caremark</span><span class="font21"> too the Chancellor’s version is actually favorable to the company when compared with how market and social arbiters previously&nbsp;interpreted the events. Chancellor Allen spends most of his opinion emphasizing&nbsp;how Caremark’s problems resulted from rogue, mid-level employees (who were&nbsp;subsequently fired) rather than from systematic breakdowns. He describes in&nbsp;detail how Caremark’s directors were proactive in their efforts to stop the&nbsp;problem once they recognized it.<sup>65</sup> Here, too, the Chancellor’s narrative comes&nbsp;close to something a company’s spokesperson would dictate: acknowledging a&nbsp;problem but isolating and localizing it, thereby assuring stakeholders that the&nbsp;likelihood of future debacles is low.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark503"></a>3.4 Implications</span></h4>
<p><span class="font21">If we agree that reputation matters in the corporate world and that the legal system affects reputation, the next step is reevaluating legal institutions by&nbsp;factoring (inter alia) how they contribute to the production of high-quality&nbsp;information. The need to reevaluate key features of corporate law along these&nbsp;lines is emphasized by the corporate legal scholarship conundrum: most scholars&nbsp;assume that the primary function of corporate litigation is deterrence,<sup>66</sup> yet we&nbsp;have not yet fully developed answers on how to evaluate deterrence.<sup>67</sup> Existing&nbsp;accounts often assume that deterrence can simply be measured through the&nbsp;outcomes of verdicts - through looking at the imposition of legal sanctions.<sup>68&nbsp;</sup>The saints-and-sinners approach adds the angle of measuring deterrence also&nbsp;through the content of verdicts - through looking at indirect deterrence through&nbsp;moralistic comments. My analysis, by contrast, does not limit itself to the&nbsp;outcomes or content of verdicts. I propose to consider also indirect deterrence&nbsp;through information production (reputational sanctions), which occurs&nbsp;throughout the process.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">This shift in perspective - adopting the informational/reputational lens -offers unique insights into key procedural and substantial doctrines in Delaware corporate law. This chapter focuses on three issues: the use of good faith&nbsp;doctrine as a pleading mechanism; judicial approval of class and derivative&nbsp;actions; and whether to assess board conduct individually or collectively.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark504"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark505"></a>3.4.1 The Good Faith Doctrine Leads to More Information and Richer&nbsp;Interpretations</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">Countless real-time analyses of the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Disney</span><span class="font21"> litigation touted Chancellor Chandler’s treatment of the duty of good faith as holding the promise to&nbsp;revolutionize corporate law. From now on, scholars told us, the enforcement of&nbsp;fiduciary duties will be ratcheted up: Delaware courts will not confine&nbsp;themselves to sanctioning just extreme cases of conflicted interests (duty of&nbsp;loyalty) or recklessness (duty of care); they instead will use the flexible duty of&nbsp;good faith to scrutinize a much wider array of misgovernance, including over-deference to the CEO.<sup>69</sup> In retrospect, we know that the duty of good faith did&nbsp;not deliver on its presumed promise: courts still refrain from imposing sanctions&nbsp;on directors.— But it would be a mistake to suggest that the good faith notion did&nbsp;not make a difference for enforcement. Sure, good faith may not have altered the&nbsp;legal outcomes of Delaware litigation, but it did shape enforcement indirectly,&nbsp;through allowing for more relevant information production in the process of&nbsp;litigation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Good faith is best seen not as a substantive doctrine but rather as a pleading mechanism.<sup>71</sup> Following the enactment of section 102(b)(7) of the Delaware&nbsp;General Corporation Law, most Delaware companies put in their charter an&nbsp;exculpatory provision shielding directors from claims of mismanagement. As a&nbsp;result, most lawsuits used to have trouble surviving motions to dismiss. Good&nbsp;faith then emerged as an antidote to the pleading gambit of defendants: when&nbsp;plaintiffs manage to frame their complaint in ways suggesting bad faith, they&nbsp;stand a chance of advancing to discovery.<sup>72</sup> And once a case proceeds to&nbsp;discovery, the horses are out of the barn: a lot of reputation-relevant information&nbsp;is produced. Through discovery, the legal system manages to tell market players&nbsp;things they do not already know about the company and businesspeople. So even&nbsp;though the threat of legal sanctions stays the same - most Delaware cases still&nbsp;settle, and in the few that do not, defendants win - the threat of reputational&nbsp;sanctions gets a boost from the liberal use of good faith to advance cases beyond&nbsp;the pleading stage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Beyond facilitating more information production through discovery, the good faith doctrine also facilitates better information production in judicial&nbsp;opinions. Scholars and practitioners have long decried Delaware’s reliance on&nbsp;this open-ended standard, arguing that it creates indeterminacy in corporate&nbsp;law.<sup>73</sup> But reliance on open-ended standards also comes with the potential&nbsp;benefit of increasing the richness and relevancy of judges’ opinions. When&nbsp;judges rely on flexible doctrines such as good faith, they are relatively free to&nbsp;select the facts and create a version of the events that they deem most relevant.—&nbsp;Moreover, an analysis that focuses on good faith notions emphasizes reputation-relevant distinctions, such as whether directors’ misconduct was intentional or&nbsp;whether the problems that directors should have monitored are deep-rooted.<sup>75</sup></span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark506"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark507"></a>3.4.2 Judicial Monitoring of Settlements in Class/Derivative Actions Is&nbsp;Key</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">Another example of procedural mechanisms that affect corporate behavior (without being fully appreciated for doing so) comes from the body of practices&nbsp;and doctrines on how to treat settlements. The overwhelming majority of&nbsp;corporate legal disputes that are not dismissed settle, so the reputational&nbsp;outcomes of litigation depend on what information emerges from settled cases.&nbsp;Three aspects of settlement dictate the quantity and quality of informed&nbsp;production: timing, openness, and judicial reasoning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The first two aspects are straightforward. Timing matters: </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">when</span><span class="font21"> the case settles determines the extent of reputational impact. In instances where the&nbsp;complaint was settled after it reached discovery, chances are that quality&nbsp;reputation-relevant information has already emerged (even if the case is settled&nbsp;before trial). Openness matters too: when the parties stipulate confidentiality in&nbsp;their settlement agreements, the prospect of information production takes a hit.&nbsp;</span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 7</span><span class="font21"> elaborates, but for now suffice to note that litigation produces an&nbsp;informational public good, and so secret settlements are a public bad.<sup>76</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The third factor - judicial involvement - requires some explanation here, as it is especially relevant in corporate law disputes. Because most corporate&nbsp;disputes are filed as class and derivative actions, most settlements are subject to&nbsp;judicial approval. As a result, Delaware judges get an opportunity to voice their&nbsp;opinion - to give their own version of how things happened - even when the&nbsp;parties themselves have settled. </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Caremark</span><span class="font21"> is a case in point: Chancellor Allen&nbsp;developed legal doctrines and generated reputation-relevant information&nbsp;(evaluating the quality of internal checks and balances and directors’ conduct)&nbsp;even though he was merely approving a settlement in a derivative action. In&nbsp;general, when judges assess whether to approve settlements, they supposedly&nbsp;already incur the costs of gathering information about the dispute. This puts&nbsp;them in a position to provide valuable information to the market.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">One policy implication, then, is that we should encourage more detailed reasoning in judicial approvals of settlements.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark508"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark509"></a>3.4.3 Should Director Liability Be Assessed Individually or&nbsp;Collectively?</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">Corporate legal scholars deal endlessly with what the standard of review for directors’ behavior should be but ignore the question of how to apply the&nbsp;analysis: whether to assess directors’ conduct one director at a time, or to look at&nbsp;the whole board collectively.<sup>77</sup> Here again, </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Disney</span><span class="font21"> serves as a great case study.&nbsp;Perhaps the most important yet overlooked doctrinal development in </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Disney</span><span class="font21"> is&nbsp;the application of a director-by-director analysis, detailing and grading each&nbsp;individual’s behavior.<sup>78</sup> The switch from a collective to an individual mode of&nbsp;analysis carries potential legal implications that have been analyzed elsewhere.<sup>79&nbsp;</sup>I want to focus here instead on the reputational implications: how does the mode&nbsp;of analysis affect information production?</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">At first glance, an individual mode of analysis is good for reputational deterrence since it generates more credible reputation information. A judge who&nbsp;analyzes each director’s conduct individually helps market players avoid a&nbsp;“clarity of responsibility” problem. Under a collective mode of analysis,&nbsp;individual directors can hide behind the others in an attempt to limit the&nbsp;reputational harm. By contrast, under an individual mode of analysis, market&nbsp;players who read the verdict (or the media’s coverage) get credible information&nbsp;on the specific quality and share of the blame for each director.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">However, a deeper look reveals contrasting dynamics. An individual mode of analysis actually may be bad for reputational deterrence under certain&nbsp;circumstances. One example that we already touched on (as is evident in </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Disney)&nbsp;</span><span class="font21">is the potential for “scapegoating” dynamics.<sup>80</sup> The individual mode of analysis&nbsp;may deflect attention away from more systematic problems at the company&nbsp;level, giving the media ready-made villains to feed the public. Moreover,&nbsp;directors will anticipate the possibility of being specifically named and&nbsp;compared to other colleagues, and this anticipation may perversely affect the&nbsp;board’s day-to-day dynamics </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">ex ante</span><span class="font21"> - such as in hurting the collegial&nbsp;atmosphere or promoting paper trails and incentives not to know.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The issue of how to assess directors’ conduct therefore is much more important than for which we give it credit. I will not develop this complicated&nbsp;issue here, for considerations of brevity and scope, but will take the risk of&nbsp;making some initial conjectures. I conjecture that switching to an individual-based mode of analysis (as in </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Disney)</span><span class="font21"> will be good for moral deterrence but bad&nbsp;for reputational deterrence. Director-by-director analysis allows for better social&nbsp;shaming or guilt-inducing since it gives those who dispense sanctions a clearer&nbsp;picture of the blameworthiness of each individual. At the same time, an&nbsp;individual mode of analysis creates a sharp separation between individual-level&nbsp;and organizational-level reputations, thereby diluting the power of reputational&nbsp;forces to control corporate behavior.<sup>81</sup></span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark510"></a>3.5 Regulatory Competition: Delaware's&nbsp;Information-Production and Ringmaster&nbsp;Abilities</span></h4>
<p><span class="font21">The reputational perspective can also help us shed new light on the endless regulatory competition debate (on whether state corporate law is a race to the&nbsp;top, to the bottom, or not a race at all). This section highlights what makes&nbsp;Delaware different than other states with established business courts. </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Section&nbsp;3.5.1</span><span class="font21"> details how Delaware’s decisional law provides private litigants with much&nbsp;more fact-finding powers than rival states. </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Section 3.5.2</span><span class="font21"> explains why the fact&nbsp;that Delaware judges frequently offer scathing commentary can actually be good&nbsp;for corporate America, as it coopts popular backlash and federal intervention.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark511"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">3.5.1 Delaware’s Information-Production Advantages</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">A few paragraphs above we noted that Delaware courts use the good faith doctrine to flush out disputes in courts and provide more granular information.&nbsp;There is a broader point here, which goes beyond a specific doctrine. Delaware&nbsp;courts have traditionally employed a tapestry of doctrines that lead to production&nbsp;of valuable information for the market. Its decisional law is geared toward&nbsp;information production, much more so than the laws of rival states with&nbsp;established business courts. Consider the following three examples: deference to&nbsp;special litigation committees (SLCs), availability of written opinions, and&nbsp;inspection rights.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">It starts with pleading standards: Delaware uses a lax standard of review when determining whether to impose legal sanctions but a more stringent&nbsp;standard of review in the pleading stage. While Delaware courts usually defer to&nbsp;the business judgment of directors, they gladly interfere when directors use their&nbsp;judgment to stifle litigation.<sup>82</sup> In other words, Delaware courts let big cases&nbsp;proceed to discovery and trial even when the odds that these complaints will&nbsp;ultimately win are slim. To illustrate, consider Delaware’s treatment of SLCs,&nbsp;with doctrines such as </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Zcpatc—</span><span class="font21"> (enhanced standard of review to SLC conduct)&nbsp;and </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Kcplcn—</span><span class="font21"> (allowing plaintiffs to seek discovery when challenging an SLC&nbsp;decision). Other states, such as New York, are much more deferential to SLCs.<sup>85&nbsp;</sup>Nowhere is the differences in information production more evident than&nbsp;when comparing Delaware to its most recent challenger - Nevada.<sup>86</sup> Delaware’s&nbsp;corporate law is much more permissive regarding the right to inspect the&nbsp;company’s books relative to Nevada.<sup>87</sup> And while Delaware’s judicial opinions&nbsp;serve important roles in providing the media with fact-based narratives and&nbsp;quotable censure, Nevada’s business court </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">does not publish opinions.'<sup>88</sup>&nbsp;</span><span class="font21">Delaware’s judicial opinions, by contrast, are published in both the state and&nbsp;regional reporters, and are readily available on commercial databases.<sup>89</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The right to inspect the company’s books is perhaps the timeliest example of Delaware’s liberal approach to information production. A key development in&nbsp;Delaware’s law came in the string of rulings of </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Corwin,— Trulia,—</span><span class="font21"> and </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">C&amp;J&nbsp;Energy Services,<sup>92</sup></span><span class="font21"> which threatened to severely curtail plaintiffs’ ability and&nbsp;incentives to reach discovery and produce valuable information on corporate&nbsp;behavior.<sup>93</sup> </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Corwin,</span><span class="font21"> in particular, maintains that the deferential business&nbsp;judgment standard of review applies where a “transaction not subject to the&nbsp;entire fairness standard of review is approved by a fully informed, uncoerced&nbsp;majority of the disinterested stockholders.”— Yet Delaware courts have quickly&nbsp;reversed the trend and restored balance, by granting liberal inspection rights.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Plaintiffs’ lawyers reacted to </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Corwin</span><span class="font21"> by concentrating efforts on making section 220 demands (i.e., requests to inspect the defendant company’s books&nbsp;and records).<sup>95</sup> Delaware’s 2017 </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Lavin</span><span class="font21"> ruling facilitated this alternative channel&nbsp;of information production, by stating that a </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Corwin</span><span class="font21"> defense (i.e., an informed&nbsp;shareholder vote) does not absolve the company from having to produce&nbsp;documents in section 220 demands.<sup>96</sup> Then, the 2019 </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">KT4 Partners LLC v.&nbsp;Palantir Technologies, Inc.—</span><span class="font21"> ruling further boosted the chances of information&nbsp;production, by broadening the scope of inside information that should be&nbsp;provided under section 220 demands. The court clarified that companies may&nbsp;have to produce internal emails and other forms of electronic communication,&nbsp;which plaintiffs can then use not only to defeat a </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Corwin</span><span class="font21"> defense (showing that&nbsp;the vote was coerced or uninformed) but also to establish breach of fiduciary&nbsp;duty claims. Shortly thereafter we have witnessed several vivid examples for&nbsp;plaintiffs successfully obtaining relevant, damning information through the&nbsp;section 220 channel.<sup>98</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">From this Book’s vantage point, Delaware’s doctrinal developments seem to have struck the right balance between deference to business judgements and&nbsp;ability to extract information on problematic behavior.<sup>99</sup></span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark512"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark513"></a>3.5.2 Make It Look Like a Struggle: the Difference between Perceived&nbsp;and Real Enforcement</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">Shifting our focus from legal outcomes (direct deterrence) to nonlegal outcomes (indirect deterrence) necessitates a reevaluation of the endless debate on how the&nbsp;content of corporate law is determined - on whether state corporate law is a race&nbsp;to the top, to the bottom, or not a race at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Those who subscribe to a saints-and-sinners approach usually advocate against a race-to-the-bottom view. The main argument of the saints-and-sinners&nbsp;approach, after all, has a normative flavor: it calls for a shift of focus from how&nbsp;seldom legal sanctions are imposed to how many nonlegal sanctions are inflicted&nbsp;(through judicial sermons).— Such a description of Delaware law is hard to&nbsp;reconcile with a race to the bottom: why should a race-to-the-bottom judge dress&nbsp;down and inflict nonlegal pain on incumbent managers?— The infliction of&nbsp;nonlegal pain is seen in this version as proof that judges do not cater to&nbsp;managers.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><a name="bookmark514"></a><span class="font21">I want to offer here an alternative perspective. While I agree that Delaware&nbsp;decisional law generates nonlegal sanctions, I think that the saints-and-sinners&nbsp;proponents miss a crucial distinction between </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">perceived</span><span class="font21"> sanctions and real&nbsp;sanctions. When legal enforcement is done indirectly (through scolding), it&nbsp;becomes far less transparent than when it is done directly (through legal&nbsp;sanctions). The public can easily assess how much a $100 million fine hurts a&nbsp;company. But the public has a hard time assessing how much verbal scolding&nbsp;actually hurts a company or individual.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font21">The reliance on judicial scolding therefore creates </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">a wedge between perceived and real enforcement.</span><span class="font21"> This wedge, in turn, allows Delaware to be&nbsp;perceived (by the public and Washington) as tougher on corporate America than&nbsp;it actually is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">My argument starts from a general assertion: under certain plausible conditions, it makes sense for a captured regulator to scold his capturers&nbsp;(regulated entities) in public. If Delaware judges do indeed cater to corporate&nbsp;America, then it is in the interests of both sides to be perceived as fighting each&nbsp;other. The emphasis here is on perceived as. If Delaware really fights and hurts&nbsp;corporate America, it risks losing incorporation fees. If, on the other hand,&nbsp;Delaware is perceived by the public as not fighting corporate America at all, it&nbsp;risks a political backlash and eventually getting overruled by Washington.<sup>102</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">To be perceived as enforcing without really enforcing, the enforcer has to adopt </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">low-visibility favoritism:</span><span class="font21"> to treat managers favorably but not openly&nbsp;favorably. In other words, both the regulator and the regulated industry want to&nbsp;“make it look like a struggle.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">We all know what “make it look like a struggle” means, even if we are unfamiliar with the exact term. We have seen it played out in countless films or&nbsp;novels.<sup>103</sup> The story is simple: our hero is captured by some bad guys. The guy&nbsp;who guards our hero, however, wants to let him escape. The problem is that the&nbsp;guard does not want the other bad guys to think of him as a traitor (in our&nbsp;terminology, as catering to the hero). As a result, the hero and the guard come to&nbsp;an agreement: “give me a black eye to make it look like a struggle”/“knock me&nbsp;out with a blow to the head”/“trash the room to make it look like a burglary.”&nbsp;You get the idea. And you probably also get the analogy: Delaware - or any&nbsp;other state trying to remain on top of a regulatory race - needs to find a method&nbsp;for being perceived by the public and Washington as delivering vicious blows to&nbsp;corporate America while not really hurting companies. And judicial scolding&nbsp;makes for an effective low-visibility favoritism method, for several reasons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">First and foremost, scolding is salient to the public. As the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Disney</span><span class="font21"> case study illustrates, mass media highlights caustic comments much more than it&nbsp;highlights the nuances of judicial decisions and legal doctrines. Scolding grabs&nbsp;headlines. The result is a public perception of Delaware judges being fed up with&nbsp;corporate America and going after the bad corporate villains. Such a public&nbsp;perception reduces the chances of political backlash, keeping Washington at bay&nbsp;and maintaining Delaware’s powers. However, what bystanders view as an all-out attack on corporate America actually is not that hurtful to those who are&nbsp;being attacked. Recall our discussion of typical scenarios where scolding is&nbsp;directed at already ousted individuals, or targets less reprehensible sins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Second, scathing commentary makes a good make-it-look-like-a-struggle tool because its damage is easily reversible. Scolding is a more flexible&nbsp;enforcement tool than are legal sanctions because it has no precedential value.&nbsp;When judges respond to a wave of corporate scandals by imposing more&nbsp;liability, they somewhat constrain their future behavior by creating precedents.&nbsp;By contrast, when judges ratchet up (perceived) enforcement via caustic&nbsp;comments, they can easily reverse the enforcement intensity once the economy&nbsp;is better and public attention drifts away from corporate governance.<sup>104</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The point about reversibility also illustrates, more generally, why enforcement through scolding may be good for Delaware companies </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">as a group.&nbsp;</span><span class="font21">A given company or director that suffers uninsurable reputational damage&nbsp;probably hates judicial scolding (ex post). But </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">ex ante,</span><span class="font21"> Delaware companies and&nbsp;businesspeople as a group are better off with scolding than with legal liability&nbsp;because scolding allows the enforcer not to commit to harsh responses down the&nbsp;road. It makes favoritism more sustainable. In that sense, Delaware operates like&nbsp;a ringmaster for corporate America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">As with any other theory about Delaware’s motivations, it is hard to offer conclusive proof that Delaware judges intentionally pursue a make-it-look-like-a-struggle strategy. What I can offer in support of my hypothesis (aside from&nbsp;logic) is circumstantial evidence, such as the explanations that Delaware judges&nbsp;themselves give. For example, when Chancellor Chandler was asked whether his&nbsp;Disney decision proves that Delaware courts are too favorable to corporate&nbsp;defendants, he responded: “how come, then, I get attacked on all sides? ...&nbsp;maybe that’s the best measure that I’m doing right.”— To me, such an answer&nbsp;indicates that even if Chandler does not intentionally try to make it look like a&nbsp;struggle, he is aware of the dynamics. Delaware judges understand that the best&nbsp;way to protect their unique reputation with the public and Washington is to give&nbsp;corporate America something to attack them for, and vice versa.<sup>106</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">To clarify, I do not claim that make-it-look-like-a-struggle dynamics are necessarily bad for overall welfare. When the risk of market or regulatory&nbsp;overreaction looms large, a make-it-look-like-a-struggle strategy actually can&nbsp;increase overall welfare by mitigating the perverse consequences of populism.<sup>107&nbsp;</sup>My goal is rather to present a tool that the Delaware judiciary (or other&nbsp;regulators) can use to fend off threats to their reputations. I cannot predict with&nbsp;certainty whether judges employ this tool cynically or public-spiritedly.— But&nbsp;we nevertheless can glean important insights from shifting our focus to the&nbsp;perception and visibility of enforcement methods. Most basically, we learn that&nbsp;recognizing a pattern of judicial scolding is not the same as proving a race-to-the-top theory. Judicial scolding may sometimes go hand in hand with a race-to-the-bottom theory (or a Delaware-Washington competition theory): by reducing&nbsp;the visibility of favoritism, scolding may help incumbent managers extract more&nbsp;rents.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Public Enforcement</span></h2>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">The SEC 's Settlement Practices</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark44"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark622"></a>4.1 Introduction</span></h4>
<p><span class="font21">Public enforcement affects reputations too. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) enforcement actions, in particular, play a key role in shaping&nbsp;the behavior of publicly traded companies. Much like with private litigation,&nbsp;SEC enforcement shapes behavior not just through imposing fines but also&nbsp;through producing information. This chapter examines how effective SEC&nbsp;enforcement practices are in generating valuable information and facilitating&nbsp;reputational sanctioning. Switching our focus from Delaware litigation to SEC&nbsp;investigations enriches our understanding of the law-and-reputation theory and&nbsp;illustrates its broad applicability. Most notably, we learn how regulatory&nbsp;enforcement actions generate different reputational dynamics than private&nbsp;litigation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Our starting point is the heated national debate that ensued at the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, over the SEC settlement practices. That debate focused&nbsp;on whether the SEC settles for large enough awards (it does). This chapter shifts&nbsp;focus and examines whether SEC settlements produce enough valuable&nbsp;information to facilitate market deterrence (they do not).</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Section 4.2</span><span class="font21"> lays the background by describing the common practice of neither-admit-nor-deny settlements. </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Section 4.3</span><span class="font21"> details the ways in which such&nbsp;SEC settlements underproduce information. </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Section 4.4</span><span class="font21"> explains </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">why</span><span class="font21"> the SEC&nbsp;has traditionally opted to underproduce information. </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Section 4.5</span><span class="font21"> examines&nbsp;whether recent changes to SEC enforcement practices can solve the information-underproduction problem, and finds them wanting. </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Section 4.6</span><span class="font21"> sketches&nbsp;alternative solutions to information underproduction, such as reevaluating the&nbsp;proper scope of judicial review of SEC actions. </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Section 4.7</span><span class="font21"> concludes with big-picture observations on the information-production qualities of SEC enforcement&nbsp;actions relative to those of private securities litigation.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark46"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark623"></a>4.2 Neither-Admit-Nor-Deny Settlements:&nbsp;the Existing Debate</span></h4>
<p><span class="font21">SEC enforcement actions historically followed a distinct pattern: the SEC learns about an alleged misconduct, investigates the matter, and then brings actions&nbsp;(files a complaint) only to simultaneously announce a pre-negotiated settlement&nbsp;with the defendants.<sup>1</sup> The typical settlement contains a three-pronged obligation&nbsp;by the defendant company: paying a fine,<sup>2</sup> agreeing to an injunction barring&nbsp;similar misconduct in the future, and agreeing not to deny the allegations. In&nbsp;return, the SEC terminates the action and allows the company not to admit the&nbsp;allegations. The agreement is then brought before a federal judge who signs it&nbsp;and turns it into a consent judgment (also known as a “consent decree”).<sup>3</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">This long-standing practice of neither-admit-nor-deny settlements went unchecked for many years, until Judge Rakoff of the Southern District of New&nbsp;York started raising questions vocally. In a sequence of three notable opinions -</span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Bank of America,<sup>4</sup> Vitesse,<sup>5</sup></span><span class="font21"> and </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Citigroup<sup>6</sup></span><span class="font21"> - Judge Rakoff decried the practice&nbsp;in general and refused to sign specific consent pacts. Other judges quickly&nbsp;followed suit, sparking a trend of increased scrutiny of SEC settlements.<sup>7</sup> In no&nbsp;time, SEC settlement practices had become the center of national attention.</span><span class="font16">8 </span><span class="font21">A&nbsp;heated debate ensued over the effectiveness of SEC enforcement and the proper&nbsp;scope of judicial review.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Those who argued against current SEC settlement practices (and consequently were in favor of enhanced judicial scrutiny) claimed that the SEC&nbsp;plays favorites with big-firm defendants, allowing them to get off with small&nbsp;fines and not admitting wrongdoing. The SEC and opponents of enhanced&nbsp;judicial scrutiny countered with two types of arguments.</span><span class="font16">9 </span><span class="font21">First, they claimed,&nbsp;there is nothing wrong with the amount of awards collected in settlements. When&nbsp;evaluating whether the collected amount makes sense, one needs to consider the&nbsp;alternative to settling: wasting limited resources on a costly litigation while&nbsp;risking not proving violations and collecting nothing. Second, the SEC claimed,&nbsp;SEC settlements contribute to sanctioning and deterrence not just through&nbsp;imposing fines but also through producing information. The SEC announces&nbsp;settlements with a press release that details the allegations, thus putting market&nbsp;players on notice about how the defendants behaved. And since defendants are&nbsp;barred from denying the allegations,— the SEC’s version goes uncontested and is&nbsp;considered reliable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Given the theme of this book, we will focus on the second type of arguments - evaluating whether SEC settlements do indeed inform market&nbsp;participants about wrongdoing. I leave aside the first type of arguments not only&nbsp;because of scope but also because I think that there is no real reason to question&nbsp;the SEC’s official line.— The SEC has incentives to maximize the amounts it&nbsp;collects even without judicial scrutiny, because this is how the SEC’s monitors -in the press, Congress, or academia - measure its success.— Take the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Citigroup&nbsp;</span><span class="font21">case as an example. The absolute maximum that the SEC could have collected&nbsp;had it fought and won a trial is $320 million;— the amount that the SEC got in&nbsp;settlement was $285 million. The SEC did not leave money on the table with&nbsp;</span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Citigroup.</span><span class="font21"> It rarely does.<sup>14</sup> Moreover, federal judges are not well positioned to&nbsp;decide questions such as whether to settle and for how much: such decisions&nbsp;require not only factoring the particulars of the case at hand but also prioritizing&nbsp;the budgetary constraints and caseload pressures of the agency.<sup>15</sup> On the other&nbsp;hand, we have plenty of reasons to question the SEC’s claim that its settlements&nbsp;provide useful information. They do not. The rest of this chapter explains why.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark48"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark624"></a>4.3 Identifying the Problem: How SEC&nbsp;Settlements Underproduce Information</span></h4>
<p><span class="font21">The SEC’s argument about the informative value of settlements misses an important distinction between the quantity and quality of information. More&nbsp;information does not necessarily translate into a better information environment.&nbsp;The SEC is right to suggest that its settlements produce more information than&nbsp;private settlements - as is manifested in summarizing the allegations in press&nbsp;releases and making detailed complaints available. But </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">the information that the&nbsp;SEC typically releases is not reputation-relevant</span><span class="font21">. It does not help market players&nbsp;distinguish between good and bad actors. In order for SEC settlements to impact&nbsp;market players’ beliefs and facilitate better reputational sanctioning, they have to&nbsp;provide new facts or credible interpretations. The typical SEC settlement fails to&nbsp;do that,<sup>16</sup> for several reasons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">First, putting the public on notice is helpful only if the public has not already noticed the wrongdoing. One influential study that examined how news&nbsp;on corporate fraud breaks, found that SEC actions break the news in only 7&nbsp;percent of the cases.<sup>17</sup> In general, when the wrongdoing is done on a large scale&nbsp;and by visible companies, the media usually covers it long before the SEC&nbsp;releases information.<sup>18</sup> In the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Bank of America</span><span class="font21"> settlement announcement, for&nbsp;example, every piece of information was stale.<sup>19</sup> The informative value of&nbsp;putting the public on notice thus depends on the baseline. To generalize: the&nbsp;notice has an informative value in actions against small broker-dealers, where&nbsp;but for the SEC announcement the violation would not have been noticed.&nbsp;Conversely, notice by itself has little informative value in settlements of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Bank of America</span><span class="font21"> and </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Citigroup</span><span class="font21"> kind, where the public had already noticed that&nbsp;something wrong had happened, and the role of the SEC was to focus on&nbsp;explaining </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">how</span><span class="font21"> exactly things went wrong: what specific control weaknesses led&nbsp;to the wrongdoing? Was it really just a low-level rogue employee or a more&nbsp;pervasive problem?</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Second, the reputational impact of settlement announcements is further diluted by the SEC’s tendency to target whole industries.<sup>20</sup> Announcing that&nbsp;company X allegedly engaged in wrongdoing does not really help market&nbsp;players if all company X’s competitors face similar allegations. Stakeholders&nbsp;cannot take their business elsewhere - cannot dispense reputational sanctions -unless the SEC provides details that distinguish between one alleged wrongdoing&nbsp;and another: which are attributed to technical errors and which reflect more&nbsp;deep-seated issues.<sup>21</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Third, </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">the SEC often lets defendants shape the content and timing of announcements.</span><span class="font21"> Most of the settlements are pre-negotiated,<sup>22</sup> and the SEC lets&nbsp;big-firm defendants minimize the reputational impact in two ways. The&nbsp;simultaneous announcement of complaint and settlement limits the negative&nbsp;publicity exposure to only one event. And it allows defendants to put a “nothing&nbsp;to see here” spin on what could have been damning indications about their&nbsp;behavior. The bad news of allegations is comingled with the good news of “case&nbsp;closed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Aside from timing, the pre-negotiation also allows defendants to shape the public perception of the SEC’s allegations by affecting the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">language</span><span class="font21"> of SEC&nbsp;announcements. As part of the negotiations, defendants get to revise the&nbsp;regulator’s drafts.<sup>23</sup> It is not just that defendants are not required to admit&nbsp;wrongdoing; they also get to dictate how the SEC’s version of what happened&nbsp;will be presented. The </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Citigroup</span><span class="font21"> case illustrates how the SEC’s public version is&nbsp;watered down compared to the SEC’s internal version. In </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Citigroup,</span><span class="font21"> the same&nbsp;misconduct (material statement) led to two complaints: one against the company,&nbsp;and one against an employee (Brian Stoker). Yet for some reason the language&nbsp;used to describe the misconduct was different. The complaint against the&nbsp;company emphasizes that no bad intentions were involved, while the Stoker&nbsp;complaint does indicate intentionality.— The complaint against Stoker mentions&nbsp;the gross revenues collected by Citigroup in the toxic transaction, while the&nbsp;complaint against Citigroup uses only the less damning net-profits figure. Both&nbsp;aspects - the degree of intentionality involved and harm done - are important&nbsp;determinants of reputational sanctions. The framing of the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Citigroup</span><span class="font21"> complaint&nbsp;therefore limited the reputational damages to the company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Finally, the SEC argues that settlement announcements are informative even without containing admissions, simply because defendants are barred from&nbsp;denying the allegations. But </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">in reality the “no denial” requirement is not (and&nbsp;perhaps cannot be) enforced.</span><span class="font21"> The information contained in the SEC allegations&nbsp;is open to interpretation and disagreement, if only because companies find ways&nbsp;to implicitly contest the allegations.<sup>25</sup> Indeed, SEC Commissioner Luis Aguilar&nbsp;himself decried the common practice of “the press release issued by a defendant&nbsp;after a settlement explaining how the conduct was really not that bad or that the&nbsp;regulator overreacted.”— Other current and former securities regulators agree&nbsp;that there is no such thing as a “no-spin zone”: defendants find various ways to&nbsp;bypass the requirement.<sup>27</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The upshot is that SEC settlements with big companies underproduce relevant information. The next question is why. SEC investigations generate&nbsp;internally high-quality information on how things went wrong; so why does the&nbsp;SEC not publicly convey information in a comprehensible and thorough way?&nbsp;Why does the SEC leave information on the table in settlements? The following&nbsp;Section locates the roots of the information-underproduction problem in the&nbsp;reputational incentives of both parties to SEC settlements.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark50"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark625"></a>4.4 Explaining the Problem: Why the SEC&nbsp;Trades Information for Fines</span></h4>
<p><span class="font21">Large publicly traded companies have incentives to pay slightly higher settlement awards as long as they can prevent unfavorable information about&nbsp;them from reaching the market. This is because negative information may&nbsp;generate reputational ramifications,— which are more risky for large companies&nbsp;than legal sanctions. </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 1</span><span class="font21"> showed us that the typical reputational sanction&nbsp;attached to revealed misconduct dwarfs the equivalent legal sanction. Moreover,&nbsp;many types of legal sanctions are paid by insurance companies, while&nbsp;reputational damages are less easily insurable. Large companies therefore&nbsp;typically fear an uptick in reputational sanctions more than they fear an uptick in&nbsp;legal sanctions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">As for the SEC’s incentives, here the story gets more complicated. One could argue that the SEC decision makers’ incentives are aligned with the public&nbsp;interest, and so whenever the SEC blocks information from getting to the market&nbsp;it is only because the benefits from settling early and for larger amounts&nbsp;outweigh the informational benefits. From that perspective information&nbsp;underproduction is not really a problem but rather a welfare-enhancing tradeoff.&nbsp;But such an argument misses how the incentives of agents work in a&nbsp;multitasking environment. When agents make tradeoffs between multiple tasks&nbsp;they tend to overemphasize the tasks that are being closely monitored by&nbsp;principals.— The SEC’s constituencies - the general public and congressional&nbsp;overseers - evaluate the SEC mostly according to readily observable yardsticks&nbsp;such as the amount of fines collected or the number of cases brought.— The&nbsp;public and Congress have difficulties in observing and attributing the indirect&nbsp;benefits from information production to the SEC. The logic of incentives&nbsp;therefore suggests that the SEC will prioritize the number of cases brought and&nbsp;the amount of fines collected. Indeed, the SEC’s own communications reflect&nbsp;such emphasis;<sup>31</sup> and former SEC staffers acknowledged that the SEC tilts the&nbsp;fines-information tradeoff against providing information and to the detriment of&nbsp;the public interest.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The upshot is that even well-meaning SEC officials face reputational pressures to favor fines over information. Before we discuss how to mitigate&nbsp;these tendencies, let us first evaluate two recent changes that the SEC has&nbsp;implemented after its public battle with Judge Rakoff. The SEC has reportedly&nbsp;switched to requiring more admissions in settlements, and filing most of its&nbsp;settlements administratively instead of before federal courts. Could these&nbsp;changes improve information production? The </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">next section</span><span class="font21"> examines.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><a name="bookmark626"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">4.5 Recent Changes in SEC Practices Did Not&nbsp;Alleviate the Problem</span></p></li></ul>
<h5><a name="bookmark627"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark628"></a>4.5.1 More Admissions</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">On paper, the SEC already seems to be trending in the right direction. Under the leadership of Chairman Mary Jo White the SEC changed its settlement policy to&nbsp;require more admissions from certain defendants.— Immediately after, in&nbsp;September 2013, the SEC announced twenty-three neither-admit-nor-deny&nbsp;settlements with firms accused of short selling;— and two days later a settlement&nbsp;where JPMorgan not only paid $200 million but also admitted wrongdoing.— In&nbsp;real time, I opined that these two announcements suggest that the SEC has its&nbsp;priorities straight going forward, based on the type of violations and the&nbsp;companies involved. The alleged violation in short-selling cases does not require&nbsp;intent, and the firms involved are not household names. By contrast, when a&nbsp;giant like JPMorgan is charged with misstating financial results and lacking&nbsp;internal controls, it becomes essential that the public gets credible detailed&nbsp;information on how things went wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">However, in the years that have passed since, scholars who systematically examined the new admission policy found it wanting.— The SEC touts its new&nbsp;policy as a great success, claiming that the increased number of admissions&nbsp;translates into greater corporate accountability. But the recent empirical studies&nbsp;adopt a more skeptical view. They agree that there has been an uptick in&nbsp;admissions, but question whether it translates into an uptick in accountability.&nbsp;These studies go over the underlying settlements, and suggest that the&nbsp;admissions are largely nominal, and the admitters are mostly small fish.&nbsp;Importantly for our information-production perspective, the studies document&nbsp;how most admissions do not pertain to the state of mind or internal checks and&nbsp;balances of the offenders. In other words, the offenders admit to the “what&nbsp;happened” question (on which the market usually already has a good grasp), but&nbsp;do not admit to the “how it happened” question (on which the market could have&nbsp;used the help from SEC investigations).</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">In fact, there may be reason to suspect that the SEC’s need to score admissions results in a </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">worse</span><span class="font21"> information environment. When the SEC&nbsp;negotiates with the misbehaving companies behind closed doors, admissions&nbsp;“confer a significant bargaining chip that companies can trade away in exchange&nbsp;for fewer incriminating disclosures.”—</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark629"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark630"></a>4.5.2 Filing Administratively</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">An even more dramatic change in SEC practices came in the form of shifting to file settlements in administrative proceedings, rather than in federal courts.—&nbsp;Filings administratively comes with several benefits. But from our perspective&nbsp;here - information production - it makes things worse. An administrative filing&nbsp;means that SEC’s negotiations with defendants are approved internally, by a&nbsp;committee of SEC commissioners, without outside review.— The lack of third-party review means it is less likely that information will become publicly&nbsp;accessible (aside from the pre-negotiated SEC press release). Further, filing&nbsp;administratively allows the SEC to regularly open and close an enforcement&nbsp;action on the same day, which, we already saw, dilutes the reputational impact of&nbsp;what the SEC internally found out about the misbehavior.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Generally, it is not surprising that changes to SEC practices tend not to lead to better information production. The root problem is the one we discussed&nbsp;earlier: the SEC is not measured according to how it facilitates reputational&nbsp;deterrence, but rather according to observable yardsticks, such as concrete&nbsp;enforcement numbers. The first step toward fixing the information-underproduction problem is therefore raising awareness to it among the SEC&nbsp;overseers and its own staff. The </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">next section</span><span class="font21"> sketches concrete implications for&nbsp;judicial review and regulatory agenda-setting.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><a name="bookmark631"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">4.6 Solving the Problem</span></p></li></ul>
<h5><a name="bookmark632"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark633"></a>4.6.1 Changes to Judicial Scrutiny</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">Armed with a fresh perspective on SEC settlements, we can revisit the evergreen question of the proper scope of judicial review. As a starting point, we should&nbsp;switch from arguing “for or against” SEC settlements to concentrating on what&nbsp;type of SEC settlements we want. The solution to current problems with SEC&nbsp;settlements is not necessarily more litigation,<sup>40</sup> but rather better-designed&nbsp;settlements and prioritizing of cases. SEC settlements can and should provide&nbsp;market players with more credible information on how exactly companies&nbsp;misbehaved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">For SEC settlements that are still filed in federal courts, judicial review can ideally nudge SEC enforcement in the direction of better information production.&nbsp;To be sure, judicial review is a very imperfect method for improving SEC&nbsp;settlements. Judges themselves are fallible and may interfere even when the SEC&nbsp;makes the right considerations.— My point here is not to advocate for more&nbsp;judicial scrutiny, but rather for better judicial scrutiny, with clear guidelines for&nbsp;its application.<sup>42</sup> I offer two simple guidelines. First, judges should generally&nbsp;maintain deference to the SEC. Interference raises the costs of settlements and&nbsp;limits the range of mutually beneficial bargains between the regulator and the&nbsp;regulated entities. Second, the main trigger for judicial intervention in rare cases&nbsp;should be information production and not severity of fines. Judges should&nbsp;interfere whenever the settlement withholds quality information on a topic that is&nbsp;of wide interest to the market.<sup>43</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">To illustrate, consider how Judge RakofEs war against neither-admit-nor-deny settlements played out. In 2014, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals reached a decision in the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Citigroup</span><span class="font21"> case, vacating Judge Rakoffs refusal to&nbsp;approve the settlement.<sup>44</sup> Seen from the informational perspective developed&nbsp;here, the Court of Appeals’ decision sets a bad precedent: it focuses the&nbsp;permissible scope of judicial review on the procedural aspects of the consent&nbsp;decree, and explicitly limits the judge’s ability to demand more information on&nbsp;what and how things happened. When this judicial tendency to not interfere in&nbsp;information underproduction is coupled with the abovementioned regulator’s&nbsp;tendency to file settlements administratively (which limits the scope for judicial&nbsp;intervention to begin with), the likely result is weaker reputational deterrence.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark634"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark635"></a>4.6.2 Changes to Enforcement Policy</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">If the SEC wishes to optimize information production and facilitate reputational deterrence, it should reprioritize its enforcement cases. The SEC needs to&nbsp;concentrate resources on cases that produce big informational benefits (disputes&nbsp;with giant financial firms), even at the expense of amassing complaints and&nbsp;litigating against smaller firms or low-level employees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">To borrow an analogy from communication science: </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">the SEC needs to shift to a “burglar alarm” mode of reporting.</span><span class="font21"> In the past decade communication&nbsp;scholars have been advocating a shift from the traditional “all the news that’s fit&nbsp;to print” mode of journalism to a burglar-alarm approach.— The idea is that&nbsp;nowadays, with the advancement of information technologies, citizens can easily&nbsp;access information on all issues. What citizens need is not more information but&nbsp;rather someone to sift the information for them: a reputable intermediary that&nbsp;will direct citizens’ scant attention to the few pieces of information that are more&nbsp;relevant and critical. The same can be said with regard to SEC settlements.&nbsp;Nowadays market players learn about financial misconduct from multiple&nbsp;sources. The SEC should therefore switch from merely putting us on notice that&nbsp;lots of bad things are happening to flagging the more problematic cases -providing detailed information on the most important cases and directing market&nbsp;players’ attention to instances where they greatly under or overstated problems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">A second proposal that could mitigate the information-underproduction problem involves changing the common practice of announcing the complaint&nbsp;and settlement together. We saw earlier that comingling the announcements&nbsp;limits the media follow-up and allows companies to put a “business as usual”&nbsp;spin on the allegations. A straightforward solution would be to disentangle the&nbsp;two announcements. The SEC should not file a settlement until, say, a week has&nbsp;passed since it announced the filing of a complaint. Think about it as a sort of&nbsp;“notice and comment” period:— the media and other intermediaries (analysts,&nbsp;institutional investors) would get to devote attention to, and weigh in on, the&nbsp;allegations. The company will have to address them. And the SEC overseers will&nbsp;have an opportunity to judge whether settling the case is in the public’s best&nbsp;interest.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark56"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark636"></a>4.7 Private Litigation vs. Public&nbsp;Enforcement: the Information-Production&nbsp;Perspective</span></h4>
<p><span class="font21">Instead of concluding by summarizing the previous sections, let us synthesize what we have learned about the reputational effects of SEC enforcement by&nbsp;comparing them to the reputational effects of private litigation. Which mode of&nbsp;enforcement injects more valuable information to the market and facilitates&nbsp;better reputational deterrence?</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">On paper, it may seem that the SEC enforcement division possesses better tools and incentives than private litigants to produce credible information. The&nbsp;SEC enjoys broader investigative powers compared to the ones private litigants&nbsp;typically enjoy in a post-PSLRA world.<sup>47</sup> And as for incentives, private litigants&nbsp;are incentivized to trade away information for money: it is not just that they&nbsp;settle too early and too often, but also that they settle too secretly. Almost every&nbsp;settlement comes with some form of a confidentiality clause.<sup>48</sup> By contrast, the&nbsp;SEC can produce press releases that detail their investigations in a fairer way&nbsp;than plaintiffs’-lawyer-worded complaints or media briefs. All this has led a few&nbsp;scholars to suggest that we can do away with private securities litigation (e.g., by&nbsp;allowing companies to adopt mandatory arbitration provisions with class action&nbsp;waivers), and instead shift more resources to SEC enforcement and&nbsp;whistleblowing programs.<sup>49</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Yet the SEC enforcement-produces-better-information-environment argument applies only in a limited sense: in a specific dispute, SEC enforcement&nbsp;may indeed be equally/more informative than private litigation. But as far as the&nbsp;big picture is concerned, the overall information that comes out of SEC&nbsp;enforcement actions as a whole </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">cannot</span><span class="font21"> fully substitute for the overall&nbsp;information that comes out due to private litigation. Private enforcement&nbsp;produces information in ways and on types of misconduct on which the SEC&nbsp;consistently underproduces information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">For one, the SEC faces budgetary constraints. It does not have the ability to pursue all investigations of misconduct that private litigators have traditionally&nbsp;taken on.<sup>50</sup> The limited resources mean that the SEC has to prioritize targets, and&nbsp;various empirical studies show that the SEC prioritizes in a distorted way. The&nbsp;SEC has historically favored going after small fish rather than big fish,— and&nbsp;provided laxer treatment for firms that are more politically connected.<sup>52</sup> The&nbsp;plaintiffs’ bar, by contrast, pursues companies with much bigger market caps&nbsp;and without apparent political biases.<sup>53</sup> Private litigation is therefore likely to&nbsp;pursue - and flush out information on - instances of corporate misconduct that&nbsp;public enforcement ignores.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">To reiterate: when we question the SEC’s incentives, we do not need to assume a hardcore regulatory capture story. Publicly spirited SEC decision&nbsp;makers maximize what they are being measured upon. And they are being&nbsp;measured upon the total amount of fines it collects and the number of&nbsp;enforcement actions it opens. From our viewpoint, the problem is that in&nbsp;pursuing these numbers the SEC too often trades off information. It often lets the&nbsp;targets of its enforcement actions influence the language and timing of the&nbsp;enforcement action press release. It tends to target whole industries for minor&nbsp;offenses. Targeting whole industries does not affect reputations: the stakeholders&nbsp;of company X cannot punish the company for misbehaving if all company X’s&nbsp;competitors face similar allegations (they cannot take their business elsewhere).</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Further, targeting companies for strict liability offenses allows the SEC to investigate and prosecute quickly, but produces little reputational value.<sup>54&nbsp;</sup>Enforcement action for a strict liability offense would tell the market that&nbsp;something happened, but would not normally elaborate on how things happened.&nbsp;It would not produce internal company documents showing who knew what&nbsp;when.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Indeed, Choi and Pritchard provided evidence that private attorneys may be better at flushing out certain types of misconduct than the SEC.<sup>55</sup> Their study&nbsp;found that the credibility of the defendant company’s disclosures takes a bigger&nbsp;hit following a standalone class action, than it does following a standalone SEC&nbsp;investigation. Institutional ownership and earnings responsiveness - both proxies&nbsp;for how the market perceives disclosure credibility - drop more for companies&nbsp;that were targeted by a class action than they do for companies that were&nbsp;targeted by the SEC.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">To be sure, private litigants’ incentives to produce information are far from perfect. Our message here is not that private litigation is categorically better than&nbsp;SEC enforcement in information production. In line with </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 2</span><span class="font21">, our message&nbsp;here is </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font21"> to treat private litigation and SEC enforcement as a horserace, where&nbsp;we need to determine who the sole winner of information production is. We can&nbsp;acknowledge that both systems are flawed, and still recognize that the systems’&nbsp;coexistence can make things better as long as each system’s flaws are&nbsp;imperfectly correlated with the other’s.</span><span class="font16">56 </span><span class="font21">For example, private litigants have&nbsp;incentives to get damning information out early in the process, to survive the&nbsp;motion to dismiss and leverage their claims into a hefty settlement. The SEC, by&nbsp;contrast, keeps any damning information it extracts confidential until after a&nbsp;settlement was reached.<sup>57</sup> </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 8</span><span class="font21"> comes back to this point, when discussing&nbsp;the mandatory arbitration revolution, which threatens to end shareholder&nbsp;litigation as we came to know it. In a world without private litigation, public&nbsp;enforcement cannot be counted on to carry the information-production load on&nbsp;its own.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Corporate Philanthropy as Signaling and Co-optation</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark59"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark694"></a>5.1 Introduction</span></h4>
<p><span class="font21">Why do business companies donate to charity? Why do some companies donate more than others? The prevalent answers to these questions usually invoke&nbsp;reputation: companies donate in hope of securing good reputation among their&nbsp;stakeholders, or so the argument goes. Yet, the same problem we observed with&nbsp;the conventional wisdom on reputational sanctions appears here as well, with the&nbsp;conventional wisdom on reputational rewards: all too often legal scholars simply&nbsp;assume that donating to charity boosts a company’s reputation, without fully&nbsp;examining how reputational rewards work, or how the legal regime influences&nbsp;companies’ reputational incentives to donate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">This chapter argues that, contrary to common wisdom, corporate philanthropy is less about boosting a firm’s reputation for being nice, and more&nbsp;about boosting a firm’s reputation for being financially sound or having good&nbsp;products. The chapter also delineates the circumstances under which companies’&nbsp;donations do not result in reputational rewards, but rather destroy value and&nbsp;become a corporate governance problem. Finally, the chapter examines how the&nbsp;existing legal regime - which in the United States is virtually a regulatory&nbsp;vacuum - hurts the ability of reputation markets to incentivize impactful&nbsp;corporate prosociality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Our starting point is the undeniable prominence of the corporate social responsibility (CSR) movement. Companies nowadays increasingly invest&nbsp;resources in activities that do not directly benefit the bottom line or meet legal&nbsp;requirements. They move to greener production, become more employee-friendly, or donate to charitable causes. The ever-growing phenomenon of&nbsp;corporate prosociality impacts not just social and environmental causes, but also&nbsp;financial allocations. Indeed, over $12 trillion are currently invested in part&nbsp;based on corporate social performance.<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Yet despite its growing importance, corporate prosociality remains an elusive phenomenon. This is especially true in the corporate law literature&nbsp;where, instead of understanding the causes and consequences of prosocial profit&nbsp;sacrificing, commentators traditionally focus their attention on the endless&nbsp;normative debate over whether corporations </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">should</span><span class="font21"> engage in non-maximizing&nbsp;activities.<sup>2</sup> Even when the focus is shifted to understanding </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">why</span><span class="font21"> companies&nbsp;behave prosocially, the discussion anachronistically alludes to the market forces&nbsp;driving corporate prosociality, without attempting to understand what affects&nbsp;those market forces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Instead of grouping all CSR activities together, I focus on the subset of corporate philanthropy (CP).<sup>3</sup> CP is defined as corporate donations to qualified&nbsp;(i.e., tax-exempt) charitable organizations.</span><span class="font16">4 </span><span class="font21">I focus, then, on behaviors that are&nbsp;more </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">explicitly</span><span class="font21"> non-maximizing. I will not focus on behaviors like treating&nbsp;employees nicely, where the expenditures are on the immediate corporate realm&nbsp;(operational profit sacrificing), or on behaviors like cause-related marketing or&nbsp;corporate sponsorships of sports events, which are more akin to traditional&nbsp;advertising. By contrast, CP lacks expectations for an immediate, direct quid pro&nbsp;quo. When a New York-based investing bank donates $10 million to build a&nbsp;shelter home for the poor in Atlanta, the beneficiaries of the donation will likely&nbsp;not buy from, work for, or invest in the company. Focusing on CP allows us to&nbsp;resist “fighting the hypothetical,” that is, evading issues arising from profit&nbsp;sacrificing by assuming that the behavior is really profit maximizing in&nbsp;disguise.</span><span class="font16">5</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The first contribution of this chapter comes from revising the current “profit-enhancing approach,” which construes CP as buying goodwill for the&nbsp;company. We cannot simply assume that companies, by acting nicely, would&nbsp;boost their reputations. Instead, we should ask: reputation for what? To whom?&nbsp;And how does CP affect it - what do outsiders infer when they observe&nbsp;companies significantly increasing their prosocial expenditures?</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The answer, I argue, lies in costly signaling. Explicit sacrifices of profits can serve as costly signals that build a firm’s reputation. They reliably convey&nbsp;messages about attributes that are important to shareholders, consumers, and&nbsp;employees, who are evaluating whether to invest in, buy products from, or work&nbsp;for those companies. For example, CP can serve as a costly signal that builds a&nbsp;firm’s reputation toward its investors. An increase in the level of donations could&nbsp;convey messages about financial strength to potential investors, who could infer&nbsp;that future free cash flows are perceived by insiders to be relatively high, that the&nbsp;company is now less financially constrained, or that the riskiness of future cash&nbsp;flows has decreased. Acknowledging the possibility that benefits arise from&nbsp;signaling also has legal implications: laws affect the flow and quality of&nbsp;information, as well as the choice of signals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The second contribution comes from revisiting the “agency-costs approach,” which views CP as a managerial perk. Yet even if we assume that CP&nbsp;decisions are driven by managerial utility, it is unclear whether they are&nbsp;detrimental to shareholder value or merely a value-neutral diversion (i.e., a&nbsp;substitute for other managerial perks within a fixed level of appropriation). The&nbsp;more relevant question, I claim, is whether insiders can use their discretion over&nbsp;corporate donations to dilute the mechanisms that are supposed to cap&nbsp;managerial agency costs. CP can be a co-optation mechanism, allowing insiders&nbsp;to escape restrictions on board independence (such as by donating to directors’&nbsp;pet charities), and campaign finance. The upshot is that some sort of legal&nbsp;intervention may be needed. Leaving agency problems totally unregulated in the&nbsp;CP context could create negative spillovers in other contexts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Finally, the chapter builds on the CP as signaling/co-optation explanations to make the case for some form of mandatory disclosure. Regulating some&nbsp;standardized, comparable, subject-to-liability form of disclosure could facilitate&nbsp;a better-functioning market for reputational rewards. At the same time,&nbsp;exploiting the potential to use undisclosed CP to co-opt governance mechanisms&nbsp;stresses the importance of not leaving CP in the dark. In this respect, legal&nbsp;intervention should focus not only on the levels of prosociality </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">(how much</span><span class="font21"> does&nbsp;the company donate), but also on its targets </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">(to whom</span><span class="font21"> does the company donate).&nbsp;Mandatory disclosure could therefore also facilitate reputational sanctions for&nbsp;abuses of CP.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The chapter proceeds in four sections. </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Section 5.2</span><span class="font21"> provides a critical synthesis of the existing literature. </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Section 5.3</span><span class="font21"> introduces my signaling theory of&nbsp;CP. </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Section 5.4</span><span class="font21"> clarifies whether and how CP could be a corporate governance&nbsp;problem. </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Section 5.5</span><span class="font21"> sketches policy implications. </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Section 5.6</span><span class="font21"> offers concluding&nbsp;thoughts by reevaluating the claim that CP serves as a reputational </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">buffer</span><span class="font21"> against&nbsp;reputational sanctions.</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark695"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">5.2 The Extant CP Literature: Data and&nbsp;Theory</span></p></li></ul>
<h5><a name="bookmark696"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark697"></a>5.2.1 Existing Data</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">We have a good grasp on the magnitude of corporate donations. American companies spend approximately $20.5 billion annually on philanthropy.</span><span class="font16">6 </span><span class="font21">These&nbsp;$20.5 billion amount to 0.9 percent of corporate pre-tax profits.</span><span class="font16">7 </span><span class="font21">While the&nbsp;absolute amounts increase over time, donations as a percentage of profits remain&nbsp;somewhat stable, around 1 percent. At the industry level, pharmaceutical&nbsp;companies give the most.</span><span class="font16">8 </span><span class="font21">At the firm level, the biggest product donors (Pfizer,&nbsp;Merck, Google) evaluate their contributions in billions, while the biggest cash&nbsp;donors (Gilead Sciences, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs) each donate around&nbsp;$300 million annually.<sup>9</sup> Among the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Fortune</span><span class="font21"> 100 companies, the median giving&nbsp;is around $63 million annually, and among the top quartile, that number jumps&nbsp;to close to $170 million.<sup>10</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">We also have a good grasp of what exactly companies donate: cash donations are clearly the most dominant form of giving, over product donations&nbsp;or employee release time.<sup>11</sup> And on the “who decides” question, it seems that&nbsp;despite a recent trend to put CP policy in the hands of specialized departments&nbsp;and professionals, CEOs still exert a lot of influence over these discretionary&nbsp;expenditures.<sup>12</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Beyond these stylized facts, the management literature has obsessed over finding a link between CP and the financial bottom line. Does doing good lead to&nbsp;doing well? We can quickly summarize the overarching patterns of this&nbsp;voluminous literature thusly:<sup>13</sup> (1) there is a small but positive association&nbsp;between social and financial performance; (2) this association is stronger for CP&nbsp;than for other social performance proxies (such as corporate policies and&nbsp;transparency); and (3) the link from financial to social performance is at least as&nbsp;strong as the reverse (i.e., doing well enables doing good; companies that&nbsp;generate more profits can afford to sacrifice more profits in the public interest).</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The main lesson is that, while we cannot conclude that companies do well </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">by </span><span class="font21">doing good, we can conclude that companies can both do well </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">and</span><span class="font21"> do good. In&nbsp;other words, there is no evident financial punishment for prosociality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Things get murkier when we try to go beyond the “in general” question (does giving generally lead to having), and identify the conditions under which&nbsp;CP increases or decreases the value of a given company.</span><span class="font16">14 </span><span class="font21">From a legal scholar&nbsp;perspective, studies linking the quality of corporate governance mechanisms and&nbsp;CP behavior are the most interesting. In theory, if there is a positive correlation&nbsp;between strong governance and CP, then the profit-enhancing approach is&nbsp;supported, and the need for legal intervention decreases. If there is a positive&nbsp;correlation between weak governance and CP, then the agency-costs approach is&nbsp;supported, and the need for intervention increases. Yet so far, empirical studies&nbsp;linking governance to CP remain largely inconclusive and open to interpretation.&nbsp;CP levels positively correlate with some proxies for weak monitoring (e.g., firms&nbsp;with low debt ratios donate more), while negatively correlating with others&nbsp;(firms with more independent boards donate more).</span><span class="font16">15</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">In summary, our knowledge of CP practices remains in a high level of generality. We know that CP is neither a huge nor an insignificant corporate&nbsp;expenditure, that top managers exert a lot of influence over these ultra-discretionary expenditures, that there is no evidence that prosociality is being&nbsp;punished financially, and that conditions leading to more giving or more profit-minded giving are hard to identify. Mainly, we know that we do not know much.&nbsp;We need better data.<sup>16</sup> Importantly, we also need a better theory: better&nbsp;articulation of the mechanisms that might link CP to outcomes that are good or&nbsp;bad for the company.<sup>17</sup></span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark698"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark699"></a>5.2.2 Existing Theory</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">Current theoretical accounts of CP fall under two main categories: the “profit-enhancing approach,” which construes CP as buying goodwill for the company, and the “agency- costs approach,” which views CP as a managerial perk. Both&nbsp;accounts suffer from under-articulation. They do not clearly identify the&nbsp;mechanisms linking CP with enhanced profits or managerial agency costs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The profit-enhancing approach usually rests on a “delegated philanthropy” assumption: the idea that when companies sacrifice profits, they simply meet the&nbsp;charitable preferences of stakeholders. Stakeholders are willing to pay more for&nbsp;companies that donate, and so when companies donate they increase demand or&nbsp;reduce their operating costs. In other words, stakeholders prefer “nice”&nbsp;companies. When consumers purchase a product from a donating company, they&nbsp;get a bundle of direct utility from consuming, and “warm glow” from buying&nbsp;products that were manufactured by nice companies.<sup>18</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Yet these delegated philanthropy explanations rely on too-unrealistic assumptions. First, while people are quick to profess in surveys their willingness&nbsp;to pay for nicer companies’ products, evidence of actual buying decisions is&nbsp;rather tenuous.<sup>19</sup> Second, even if you believe that declarations in surveys do&nbsp;translate into actions, you cannot conclude that CP is especially effective at&nbsp;buying goodwill. After all, in those surveys consumers profess much stronger&nbsp;preferences for other prosocial expenditures, such as labor and environmental&nbsp;issues, than for cash donations.— Third and perhaps most pertinently, evidence&nbsp;shows that consumers are too often unaware of different levels of CP.<sup>21</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Finally, even if consumers have meaningful charitable preferences, and even if they are able (i.e., aware of CP levels) to act upon them, one still needs to&nbsp;explain why consumers would want to delegate charity. Instead of paying more&nbsp;for a nice company’s product, consumers can pay for a value-adjusted cheaper&nbsp;product of a non-sacrificing firm. Consumers can then use the cash saved to&nbsp;satisfy their own charitable preferences, which, in all likelihood, differ&nbsp;somewhat from those of the donating company’s managers.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The agency-costs approach, by contrast, suggests that the seemingly irrational CP phenomenon is completely rational from a corporate decision-maker standpoint. The impetus driving CP behavior is private benefits to&nbsp;corporate insiders. A manager donating with shareholders’ money gets&nbsp;invitations to board seats, tickets to gala events, esteem from her peers, personal&nbsp;satisfaction of her own altruistic preferences, and warm glow.</span><span class="font16">23</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">One problem with such managerial-utility explanations is that they do not fully explain why managers would choose CP as a channel to reap private&nbsp;benefits, rather than other channels such as negotiating for higher pay/perks. If&nbsp;the manager engages in CP to get warm glow and satisfy her own charitable&nbsp;preferences, she could arguably get more warm glow from negotiating higher&nbsp;pay and then donating the extra dollars in her own name. Indeed, existing data&nbsp;casts doubt on mechanisms that were traditionally offered to link CP to&nbsp;managerial utility. For example, one study found that firms that pay their CEOs&nbsp;more are not the ones donating more, and another found that replacing the CEO&nbsp;does not change the firm’s donating policy.— Another problem with&nbsp;managerial-utility accounts is that they often fail to clearly answer the “so&nbsp;what?” question: assuming CP is indeed driven by managerial utility, is it&nbsp;necessarily bad for the company, the shareholders, or overall welfare?</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Both the profit-enhancing and agency-costs approaches therefore suffer from serious theoretical flaws. And the existing empirical evidence on which&nbsp;captures reality better is inconclusive. Even findings presumed to favor one&nbsp;approach can be interpreted to cut both ways, at least until the mechanisms that&nbsp;link CP to company-level and managerial-level benefits are better articulated.—&nbsp;The next two sections attempt to do just that: provide a better explanation of the&nbsp;mechanisms in play.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark63"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark700"></a>5.3 CP as a Costly Signaling Mechanism</span></h4>
<p><span class="font21">To illustrate the problem with the buying-goodwill explanation for CP, consider a puzzling pattern identified by a famous study, which tested whether and how&nbsp;prosociality reduces labor costs.<sup>26</sup> The buying-goodwill argument generates two&nbsp;hypotheses: (1) companies that donate more will do better at attracting potential&nbsp;job applicants; (2) the abovementioned effect will be mediated by the applicants’&nbsp;“social preferences.” In other words, applicants who feel strongly about social or&nbsp;environmental issues will be more attracted to prosocial companies. The study’s&nbsp;findings were consistent with the first hypothesis, but inconsistent with the&nbsp;second. Job applicants did consider prosocial companies as more attractive&nbsp;places to work. But the effect was </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font21"> mediated by the applicants’ social or&nbsp;environmental preferences. Job applicants considered prosocial companies as&nbsp;more attractive to work for, </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">regardless</span><span class="font21"> of whether applicants cared about social&nbsp;issues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">This empirical pattern suggests that something else is in play here, beyond the supposed preference for nicer companies. Even strictly profit-minded&nbsp;stakeholders prefer companies that are nice; not because of the niceness per se,&nbsp;but rather because niceness is an indication of something else. The interesting&nbsp;questions are thus: what is prosociality indicative of, and how exactly can&nbsp;prosociality be credibly indicative of other traits?</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark701"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark702"></a>5.3.1 The Basic Story: Signaling Financial Strength</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">Our starting premise is that there exists asymmetric information about companies’ underlying attributes. Insiders know more than outsiders. Both have&nbsp;incentives to mitigate the asymmetry. One method for insiders to mitigate&nbsp;asymmetries is to communicate information to target audiences about&nbsp;unobservable qualities through observable activities. This is the basic&nbsp;background of a costly signaling story.<sup>27</sup> As applied here, profit sacrificing in&nbsp;general and CP in particular can serve as costly (thereby credible) and&nbsp;observable attributes, conveying messages about unobservable attributes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Consider for example the potential of using CP to signal future free cash flows. The signaler in our informal model is the company, or, more precisely, its&nbsp;decision-makers (top management in widely held companies, or dominant&nbsp;shareholders). Receivers of the signal - the target audience - are outside&nbsp;investors. One important attribute for how outsiders evaluate the company is&nbsp;future free cash flows. Because future free cash flows are not readily observable&nbsp;by outsiders, they make a plausible subject for costly signaling.<sup>28</sup> What could&nbsp;constitute an observable costly attribute that credibly conveys messages about&nbsp;future cash flows? In the current context, big changes in cash donations could fit&nbsp;the bill. Cash donations are costly in an intuitive manner: insiders decide to take&nbsp;a dollar that they could have used to meet the demands of contractual claimants,&nbsp;and instead give it to unrelated third parties. Outsiders that observe a company&nbsp;substantially increasing its expenditures on prosocial profit sacrificing will infer&nbsp;that the company’s insiders perceive their ability to procure future resources as&nbsp;better than was previously evaluated. Outsiders then update their forecasts about&nbsp;the company’s prospects accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">But for such a signal to work, it needs to be more than just costly. It has to be costlier for low-quality companies in order to avoid mimicry (the costs have&nbsp;to be differentiating and quality-dependent). In the current context, cash&nbsp;donations need to be costlier for firms with low future free cash flows than for&nbsp;those with high cash flows. One could argue that companies with low future cash&nbsp;flows can finance a high level of donations out of retained earnings or external&nbsp;finance. If insiders can simply borrow money to raise their CP levels even when&nbsp;times are bad, then outsiders will not change their valuations based on observing&nbsp;CP.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Yet empirical studies showing that corporate goodness is costlier for financially constrained firms refute this argument.— There are several possible&nbsp;reasons behind such a link between corporate goodness and financial constraints.&nbsp;For one, borrowing to finance the donations is costlier for companies with&nbsp;relatively bad future prospects because it requires them to expose themselves to&nbsp;unfavorable covenants or disclosure requirements.— Furthermore, there is&nbsp;evidence that managers care deeply about meeting earnings benchmarks and&nbsp;smoothing earnings, to the extent that they will even sacrifice projects with&nbsp;positive net present value to set aside buffer cash.<sup>31</sup> Thus, it is plausible to&nbsp;assume that insiders in low quality firms will find it more costly to spend ultra-discretionary dollars on CP, since they need all the cash buffers they can get.&nbsp;Outsiders observing a large increase in CP levels could therefore infer that&nbsp;insiders know they are not going to be financially constrained.<sup>32</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Stated differently, the conditions for costly signaling are as follows. First, companies vary in their ability to generate future free cash flows. Second,&nbsp;outside investors cannot readily observe future free cash flows, and stand to gain&nbsp;from knowing more about them. Third, at the same time, outsiders cannot simply&nbsp;believe all direct messages from insiders about future free cash flows; insiders&nbsp;stand to gain from sending exaggerated signals. So, outsiders resort to making&nbsp;inferences based on some observable, costly behaviors of companies, and the&nbsp;fact that the behavior is costly assures the credibility of the signal. Low-quality&nbsp;signalers cannot incur the same amount of costs as high-quality signalers.&nbsp;Fourth, one such observable behavior is explicit profit sacrificing. Big cash&nbsp;donations will carry information about the prospects of the company as long as&nbsp;the costs of donating are negatively correlated with an ability to generate future&nbsp;free cash flows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">If these propositions are plausible, then we can assume that communication through profit sacrificing will be informative. Yet a fully conscious, meditated&nbsp;decision to sacrifice profits with a clear intent to signal financial strength is not&nbsp;needed. When the above propositions apply, we can assume that some “design&nbsp;force” - conscious decision-making, market forces selection, or imitation of&nbsp;successful companies - will instill in CP the tenets of a costly, informative signal&nbsp;of financial strength. But are all these propositions really plausible? The </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">next&nbsp;section</span><span class="font21"> elaborates on potential limitations, in order to identify the specific&nbsp;circumstances under which we can expect signaling by conspicuous goodness.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark703"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark704"></a>5.3.2 Refining the Basic Story: Limitations</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">Before concluding that prosocial profit sacrifices bring benefits through signaling, several conditions and limitations need to be addressed. Consider the&nbsp;following four potential limitations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">First, CP is just one of many other signals available. If throwing cash away serves as a signal for an ability to procure resources, why should companies&nbsp;throw it away on charitable organizations? Why not throw it on investors, in the&nbsp;form of dividends?<sup>33</sup> Alternatively, why not throw it on conspicuous&nbsp;consumption, such as building luxurious headquarters, or purchasing lavish&nbsp;perks?— All it takes is for a firm to sacrifice profits, so why make the sacrifice in&nbsp;the public interest? The key to answering this question is acknowledging that&nbsp;signaling through prosocial sacrifices does not preclude the use of other signals.&nbsp;In real life, unlike in models, multiple messages are conveyed by multiple&nbsp;means.— The real question, then, is not choosing CP over another expenditure,&nbsp;but what the mix of signals chosen in the given circumstances will be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Think about the choice between signaling through increasing dividends and signaling through increasing CP expenditures. For most firms, the choice is&nbsp;nonexistent, as they never pay dividends.<sup>36</sup> For firms that do pay dividends, and&nbsp;can use dividends as signaling financial strength, it still may make sense to use&nbsp;CP as a </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">backup signal:</span><span class="font21"> another signaling channel to convey the same message.&nbsp;Signaling through multiple channels (rather than exaggerating signals through&nbsp;the same channel) makes sense when receivers are prone to err in evaluating&nbsp;signals.<sup>37</sup> The corporate environment fits the conditions of an error-prone&nbsp;environment: noisy communications, strong incentives to cheat, widely varying&nbsp;perceptions and preferences of receivers, and accelerating signaling costs.<sup>38</sup> A&nbsp;corporate decision maker who wishes to signal good prospects, may supplement&nbsp;the increase in dividends with an increase in CP levels, to make sure that&nbsp;outsiders get the right message (e.g., that outsiders are not attributing an increase&nbsp;in dividends to bowing to pressures from shareholders eager for payouts). While&nbsp;this CP-as-backup-signal speculation is ultimately a matter for future pinpointed&nbsp;empirical research, existing evidence indicates that it is not far-fetched. Firms&nbsp;that pay out more also donate more.<sup>39</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">A second potential criticism is that CP is not costly enough to be a costly signal. To be sure, CP does cost something, but is it truly a handicap to big&nbsp;firms? After all, CP levels in many companies represent only a “modest&nbsp;incremental cash drain on resources available to managers,”— and modest costs&nbsp;cannot differentiate between high- and low-quality signalers. To accommodate&nbsp;this valid objection, we need to refine our predictions regarding benefits arising&nbsp;from signaling. Prosociality will convey credible messages about future financial&nbsp;prospects only when conducted on a large scale relative to a company’s size and&nbsp;resources. Day-to-day marginal contributions are not likely to generate signaling&nbsp;benefits; big changes in CP policy are.<sup>41</sup> For example, in March 2008, when&nbsp;Goldman Sachs announced a new $100 million CP program meant to further&nbsp;business education of women in the developing world, outsiders took notice.<sup>42&nbsp;</sup>Outsiders were free to infer that Goldman’ s top managers simply cared about the&nbsp;cause of women’ s business education, or that they were hoping to buy goodwill&nbsp;by appearing nice. But outsiders may also have inferred that Goldman’s&nbsp;managers thought that the company could afford to sacrifice profits much more&nbsp;than it had previously because future prospects were looking brighter.<sup>43</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">A third potential criticism would point out that CP is not sticky enough to be an effective signal. If a certain expenditure is completely discretionary, then it&nbsp;cannot be a good signal. Signals need to have some level of stickiness to be&nbsp;reliable because something removable at will is not a true handicap. To&nbsp;accommodate this limitation, we first need to understand that the stickiness of&nbsp;signals is not a binary matter. While CP might be less sticky than other prosocial&nbsp;expenditures (such as reversing expenditures on employees’ working&nbsp;conditions), anecdotal evidence indicates that there is a degree of asymmetric&nbsp;stickiness to CP. Managers enjoy much flexibility when deciding to initiate or&nbsp;raise CP levels, but there are costs to omitting or dropping existing levels. For&nbsp;example, managers fear reputational sanctions and personal pressures from&nbsp;NGOs or social rating indices if the company drops its support.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">A fourth potential limitation of the signaling theory is that prosociality is not observable to outsiders in a timely and useful manner. Although this&nbsp;limitation applies more strongly to operational profit sacrificing than to CP -cash donations in particular are readily communicated and quantified - this is&nbsp;still a strong limitation. Disclosure of CP is unregulated, and this creates an&nbsp;environment in which it is difficult for companies to reliably convey the relative&nbsp;level of their explicit prosociality.<sup>45</sup> Though lack of regulation is likely to reduce&nbsp;the benefits from signaling, it will not totally eliminate them. We should think of&nbsp;it as creating conditions for some </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">coarse</span><span class="font21"> signaling story: companies wishing to&nbsp;distinguish themselves can voluntarily disclose their conspicuous goodness in a&nbsp;wide and timely manner, but outsiders will be able to distinguish between&nbsp;companies based on their CP levels only when the differences across companies&nbsp;and time are great. Again, the conclusion is that the profit sacrifices most likely&nbsp;to generate signaling benefits are big changes, which are easily communicated to&nbsp;outsiders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Having accommodated all those considerations, we are now left with a limited, refined story of corporate prosociality as a signal to outside investors.&nbsp;Only sacrifices that are relatively significant in size, readily observable, and not&nbsp;easily reversed can be expected to serve as an effective signal. Granted, these&nbsp;limitations confine the applicability of the signaling story to only a small number&nbsp;of actual CP decisions. Yet it is precisely those few large donations that are&nbsp;practically important; a small number of donations comprise the bulk of overall&nbsp;corporate giving expenditures and raise the most concerns. The signaling-to-investors story is therefore relevant to the more significant and/or controversial&nbsp;cases of CP, and thus merits attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Furthermore, even when circumstances make the signaling-to-investors story unlikely, CP can affect the company’s reputation for other attributes, and&nbsp;among other crowds. For example, donating products or employee release-time&nbsp;might be ineffective as signals to investors looking for information on future&nbsp;financial strength, but effective as signals to employees looking for information&nbsp;on management’s commitment to a certain corporate culture. It is these other&nbsp;sorts of signaling stories - signaling to nonfinancial stakeholders - to which we&nbsp;now turn.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark705"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark706"></a>5.3.3 Other Possible Stories: Signaling Product Quality&nbsp;or Workplace Attractiveness</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">The story of corporate donations signaling financial strength is only one of several potential signaling stories. Acts of corporate niceness can also have other&nbsp;informational contents (not just financial strength) and target audiences (not just&nbsp;investors). Consider the following three examples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">First, think about a signaling-to-customers model, where high levels of corporate donations convey information about the quality of the firm’s&nbsp;product.<sup>46</sup> Such a model assumes two types of entrepreneurs. One type has&nbsp;other-regarding preferences, and thus cares about externalities, and the other&nbsp;type lacks those preferences and cares only about profits. For the other-regarding&nbsp;types, sacrificing profits is less costly, as they gain warm glow by refraining&nbsp;from externalities. By contrast, for the purely profit-motivated entrepreneurs, CP&nbsp;is a total sacrifice. Accordingly, the model assumes that when customers observe&nbsp;a company engaging in higher CP levels than its competitors, they infer that&nbsp;insiders in this company will be more averse to sacrifice unobservable qualities&nbsp;of products than their competitors are (because sacrificing product quality will&nbsp;generate externalities, which will in turn decrease the other-regarding&nbsp;entrepreneur’s utility).</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">This CP-as-signaling-product-quality theory addresses some of the flaws in the delegated philanthropy accounts. It argues that CP is value-enhancing not&nbsp;because it satisfies customers’ preferences for nice companies, but rather&nbsp;because it mitigates informational gaps about attributes relevant to the&nbsp;company’s line of business. Yet the specifics of this signaling-to-customers&nbsp;theory still rest on some shaky assumptions. Just like delegated philanthropy&nbsp;explanations, the signaling-to-customers theory assumes that charitable&nbsp;preferences drive corporate behavior - only here, the preferences are those of&nbsp;entrepreneurs rather than consumers. Such an assumption might be plausible in&nbsp;manager-owned, small companies where the entrepreneur is tantamount to the&nbsp;company, but it is less plausible for large impersonal corporations. Further, the&nbsp;theory assumes that information on CP levels can be easily observed and&nbsp;compared by customers who make purchases accordingly, but academic&nbsp;evidence on the ground suggests that consumers’ awareness of CP policies is&nbsp;actually low.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">A second possibility for prosociality to generate signaling benefits is through attracting high-quality employees. This relates to the puzzling empirical&nbsp;pattern discussed above: job applicants preferred prosocial companies regardless&nbsp;of how they felt about prosociality itself.— So what did the level of prosociality&nbsp;teach applicants about the company? Can a company’s niceness boost its&nbsp;reputation for workplace conditions? Why would building a shelter home for the&nbsp;poor improve the company’s reputation for how it treats its employees?</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">For one, prosociality could have sent a message about a “cooperative” corporate culture. Applicants may figure that top managers who commit to spend&nbsp;more on charity are not solely short-term-profits-hungry. These are the managers&nbsp;that you assume will not fire you or nickel-and-dime you in every chance they&nbsp;get. By explicitly sacrificing profits in the public interest, insiders can credibly&nbsp;and visibly commit to a certain culture, thereby attracting job applicants who&nbsp;will fit the culture.— Note that the signaling-to-workers hypotheses are more&nbsp;relevant in high-quality labor industries, and so in those industries we should&nbsp;expect more CP, all else being equal. Perhaps it is yet another factor explaining&nbsp;the dominance of pharmaceutical and technology companies among the largest&nbsp;corporate donors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">A third example of an alternative signaling story takes us back to investors as the intended audience, but this time with a different message: big increases in&nbsp;CP can convey fundamental information not only about the level of future free&nbsp;cash flows, but also about systematic decreases in </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">riskiness</span><span class="font21"> of future cash flows.&nbsp;In other words, observing a big donation can make investors update the&nbsp;denominator rather than the numerator in the discounted cash flow formula.&nbsp;When projections of cash flows become less risky, insiders can make better&nbsp;assessments of their future opportunities and opportunity costs, and can thus&nbsp;better maximize the level of prosocial sacrifices - they need fewer cash buffers.&nbsp;In this respect, prosociality could mitigate asymmetric information about&nbsp;changes along the life cycles of organizations and managerial reactions to those&nbsp;changes.—</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark707"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark708"></a>5.3.4 Adding Complexity</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">We have sketched the contours of basic signaling explanations to corporate prosociality. But it is important to note potential layers of complexity that can be&nbsp;followed through in future research, such as the choice between prosocial and&nbsp;wasteful signals, the possibility for errors in signaling, and costs from attracting&nbsp;the wrong reaction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">A necessary condition for costly signaling is that the behavior will be costly to the signaler. But nothing in the model requires the behavior to actually benefit&nbsp;others. The handicap can be prosocial, but it can just as well be wasteful (as in&nbsp;conspicuous consumption). A fuller analysis should thus account for conditions&nbsp;under which prosocial signals are more effective than wasteful ones. For&nbsp;example, if receivers have preferences for prosocial displays and if such displays&nbsp;receive greater attention (known as the “broadcast efficiency” of the signal), then&nbsp;the signaler should prefer them to wasteful handicaps.<sup>51</sup> The choice of signals&nbsp;also has policy implications. Society might be better off when corporate&nbsp;signaling is done via prosocial handicaps, rather than wasteful ones<sup>52</sup> - think&nbsp;donations versus gold-embroidered shower curtains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">It is also important to take fuller account of errors in signaling communication. We have already mentioned that receivers are error-prone when&nbsp;perceiving signals in noisy environments. Signalers can be error-prone, too. For&nbsp;example, corporate managers are overly optimistic.— When deciding CP levels&nbsp;based on their upwardly biased perception of future prospects, managers might&nbsp;“advertise” too much, that is, engage in too much CP. A bias in forecasting&nbsp;future cash flows erodes the value of the signal and at some point the signaling&nbsp;stops being informative.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Finally, future research could also consider the possibility of another type of cost to the signaler - namely, attracting an unintended observer or provoking&nbsp;an unintended reaction from target audiences. Explicit profit sacrificing is&nbsp;conspicuous, and conspicuousness can attract predators who think that the&nbsp;signaler has too much waste. Activist hedge funds are a case in point. When&nbsp;activist hedge funds observe a company increasing its profit sacrificing, they&nbsp;may decide to target the company because of the slack it obviously possesses.&nbsp;Regardless of whether activist hedge funds are beneficial to overall welfare,&nbsp;incumbent managers usually want to avoid attracting them. Insiders worried&nbsp;about attracting hedge funds could be pushed to choose suboptimal signaling&nbsp;levels </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">ex ante.</span><span class="font21"> Future empirical research could try to shed light on this&nbsp;speculation by examining, for example, whether changes in CP policies attract&nbsp;certain investors.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark709"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark710"></a>5.3.5 Fit with Evidence</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">When I started writing about CP as signaling, a decade ago, there was little firm-specific evidence that could lend credibility or discard my hypotheses. I therefore relied mostly on stylized facts and industry-level data, pointing to&nbsp;patterns that were inconsistent with the prevalent delegated philanthropy&nbsp;approach, but consistent with my signaling approach. For example, a signaling-cash-flows theory predicts a higher level of CP in companies and industries&nbsp;where future free cash flows are less readily observable by outsiders, free cash is&nbsp;perceived to be good for the company,<sup>54</sup> and other channels for signaling cash&nbsp;flows are blocked or too costly. The fact that pharmaceuticals and technology&nbsp;companies are among the largest donors is consistent with these predictions.<sup>55</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Another empirical pattern I pointed out that could not be reconciled with the existing approaches is that CP - the most discretionary, explicit form of&nbsp;profit sacrificing - has a stronger association with financial performance than&nbsp;other corporate social performance expenditures. The signaling story, by&nbsp;contrast, fits this empirical pattern. Cash donations are more effective signals&nbsp;than operational profit sacrifices; they are more easily communicated and&nbsp;quantifiable to outsiders. And the fact that they benefit unrelated third parties&nbsp;(i.e., are more explicit sacrifices) means that they are perceived as greater&nbsp;handicaps than operational sacrifices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Relatedly, existing theories cannot explain the dominance of cash over in-kind donations. Traditional profit-enhancing theories predict that in-kind donations would yield better results than cash donations in terms of tax&nbsp;advantages, better bundling of warm glow with intrinsic utility, and stronger&nbsp;consumer preferences. Yet the opposite is observed: cash donations generate&nbsp;better reputational payoffs.<sup>56</sup> Why? I proposed that some of the value&nbsp;enhancement comes from signaling: cash donations are more effective signals&nbsp;because they are easily observable and less open to interpretation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">In recent years, several empirical studies directly tested the signaling hypothesis, and corroborated it. Large-N studies now explicitly state that the&nbsp;signaling hypothesis is a better fit with evidence than the buying goodwill&nbsp;hypothesis.<sup>57</sup> A couple of studies explicitly find that cash donations are more&nbsp;strongly related to better financial performance and firm value than in-kind&nbsp;donations.<sup>58</sup> Several of my other conjectures remain untested, though: whether&nbsp;conspicuous philanthropic activity attracts hedge funds activism, whether&nbsp;companies operating in an environment with high levels of asymmetric&nbsp;information signal in multiple channels (e.g., both dividends and CP), and so on.&nbsp;These remain avenues for potential future research.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark65"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark711"></a>5.4 CP as a Co-optation Mechanism</span></h4>
<p><span class="font21">After examining how CP can be good for the company, let us now understand how CP can also be bad for the company. The existing accounts of the negative&nbsp;sides of CP usually adopt an agency-costs perspective, claiming that managers&nbsp;use shareholders’ money to donate to their own pet charities. While it is not&nbsp;contested that CP is driven to some extent by managerial-utility considerations,&nbsp;there is still a lively debate around the extent, and the implications. We enrich&nbsp;this debate by introducing an oft-ignored distinction between profit-sacrificing&nbsp;expenditures that merely </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">reflect</span><span class="font21"> agency costs, and those that actually </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">aggravate&nbsp;</span><span class="font21">agency costs. CP is not really bad for the company if it merely reflects existing&nbsp;problems. It starts being a problem once managers can use their discretion over&nbsp;CP money to weaken corporate governance.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark712"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark713"></a>5.4.1 Motivating Examples</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">It is best to start with a concrete example that illustrates the distinction between problem-reflecting and problem-generating CP: juxtaposing the infamous cases&nbsp;of Occidental Petroleum Co. (Oxy) and Enron. Oxy donated more than $85&nbsp;million (a third of its annual profits) to a museum named after Armand Hammer,&nbsp;its soon-to-retire CEO. Enron was much more modest; the company donated&nbsp;between $1 and $2 million to a medical center headed by a member of the board&nbsp;audit committee, and several hundred thousand to a think tank that employed&nbsp;another independent director.— Usually, agency explanations of CP lump both&nbsp;instances together. In both cases, decision makers used discretion over corporate&nbsp;profit-sacrificing money to satisfy the preferences of top management. Seen&nbsp;from this angle, the Oxy case is much more detrimental to company and&nbsp;shareholder interests simply because the sacrifice is larger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">But is it really more problematic? In Oxy’s case, the donation was disclosed, as the amount was material enough to mandate disclosure under the&nbsp;securities laws. No adverse impact on stock prices was observed when the&nbsp;sacrifice was announced,— perhaps because the market already anticipated that&nbsp;Armand Hammer controlled the board and could pass decisions on whatever&nbsp;other types of profit sacrificing that he pleased. Arguably, no agency costs were&nbsp;created because of this donation; it only reflected existing agency costs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">By contrast, Enron consistently pursued a CP policy that undermined the checks and balances on corporate governance. Perhaps not surprisingly, its&nbsp;donations were not disclosed. The direct hit to the financial bottom line from&nbsp;those donations was insignificant, but what mattered more than the levels of the&nbsp;donations were the targets of the donations. The choice of targets made it&nbsp;somewhat less likely that the CEO would be asked tough questions later. In my&nbsp;view, these latter types of donations represent a corporate governance problem&nbsp;justifying legal intervention even more than the former type of pure self-aggrandizement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The Enron case illustrates the possibility that managers will use their discretion to sacrifice profits to entrench themselves and weaken the&nbsp;mechanisms that monitor them. It therefore pokes holes in the existing debate. A&nbsp;generic objection to the “CP-is-bad-for-the-company” arguments rests on a&nbsp;“fixed appropriation” logic. Say a manager used company’s money to donate to&nbsp;her favorite charity. Such a donation does </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font21"> hurt shareholders, as long as we&nbsp;assume managerial discretion is capped by market and/or contractual&nbsp;mechanisms. If managerial discretion is not limitless, then increased use of&nbsp;discretion to sacrifice profits prosocially may come at the expense of other&nbsp;managerial expenditures, such as executive pay and perks. Benefits that&nbsp;managers achieve through CP will offset other forms of managerial&nbsp;appropriation.<sup>61</sup> Scholars have attacked the fixed appropriation argument on&nbsp;various grounds.<sup>62</sup> What the Enron example illustrates is a different&nbsp;(nonexclusive) rebuttal: CP as co-optation, to which we turn next.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark714"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark715"></a>5.4.2 Mechanisms of Co-optation</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">Managerial discretion in an unregulated channel like CP can be used to co-opt those in charge of monitoring. Let us focus on three governance mechanisms:&nbsp;using CP money to co-opt independent directors, influence politicians, and ally&nbsp;with activist stakeholders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The first channel through which CP can generate agency costs is co-optation of board independence. The point here is that managers use CP not merely to donate to their own pet charities, but also to donate to the pet charities&nbsp;of those who are supposed to monitor the mangers. This pattern is not limited to&nbsp;the Enron case. Look to other postmortem analyses of failed governance&nbsp;mechanisms and you will find similar tactics in play. Ross Johnson did it at RJR&nbsp;Nabisco,<sup>63</sup> Conrad Black at Hollinger,<sup>64</sup> and Dennis Kozlowski at Tyco,<sup>65</sup> to&nbsp;name but a few. As board independence has become a governance panacea,<sup>66</sup> the&nbsp;attractiveness of CP as a backdoor channel to influence directors without losing&nbsp;their “independent” tag will likely only increase.<sup>67</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">A second mechanism that makes CP a corporate governance issue is the use of money designated as CP to influence politics. The ability and willingness of&nbsp;corporations to use CP in politics is especially relevant today. In the aftermath of&nbsp;the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Citizens United v. FEC—</span><span class="font21"> decision, there has been a lively discussion in&nbsp;Congress, the SEC, and legal academia on the need to introduce protective&nbsp;mechanisms for explicit political spending. Not enough attention, however, has&nbsp;been directed to the possibility of bypassing protective mechanisms through&nbsp;corporate donations to tax-exempt “charitable” organizations that serve as&nbsp;conduits for political influence; that is, implicit political spending. CP is&nbsp;relatively unregulated, so managers have incentives to couch political spending&nbsp;as CP in order to evade restrictions on explicit political donations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The means exist to effectuate this managerial will. While under IRC § 501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations may not legally engage in political activity,&nbsp;there is ample room to characterize political activity as “educational,” thus&nbsp;maintaining an organization’s tax-exempt status. Two notable ways to engage in&nbsp;politicized CP are: first, funding think tanks that qualify as educational&nbsp;organizations while de facto supporting very specific policies or politicians.&nbsp;And, second, supporting classic advocacy organizations (also known as § 501(c)&nbsp;(4) organizations) with CP money, through the “c3/c4 split” (i.e., lobbying&nbsp;organizations establishing a complementary tax-exempt entity that is heavily&nbsp;funded by corporations).— Indeed, a recent strand of empirical studies managed&nbsp;to spotlight the usage of covert political activities.— One study in particular&nbsp;shows that firms use charitable contributions through their foundations as a tax-exempt lobbying mechanism. The use of CP as lobbying, they conclude,&nbsp;amounts to over $ 1 billion a year - much more than lobbying through political&nbsp;action committees (PACs).<sup>71</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">A separate question is whether usage of CP as a covert political influence mechanism is bad for shareholders. If insiders use their clout over politicians to&nbsp;further favorable policies, then society as a whole may suffer, but the&nbsp;shareholders of a given company may actually value the purchase of political&nbsp;clout with CP money. Yet managers can also use political donations to further&nbsp;narrow, managerial interests, such as lowering investor protection. Consider the&nbsp;case of managerial lobbying for anti-takeover legislation. When Dayton Hudson,&nbsp;a Minnesota corporation, became a target for takeover in 1987, the managers&nbsp;convinced the state to hold a special legislative session where the company’s&nbsp;charitable record was used as consideration for enacting a new anti-takeover&nbsp;bill.— More generally, when diversified shareholders hold the market portfolio,&nbsp;and managers use CP money to purchase policies that favor one company at the&nbsp;expense of another, then CP expenditures amount to a transfer with deadweight&nbsp;costs.<sup>73</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">A third, less intuitive use of CP to generate further agency costs is as a subtle anti-takeover mechanism. Managers can invest strategically in profit&nbsp;sacrificing in order to gain support from activists, such as consumer groups or&nbsp;public pension funds. Those activists are then expected to return the favor by&nbsp;reducing the probability of CEO turnover. Even if a potential raider can increase&nbsp;a company’s value, activist stakeholders will have incentives to keep incumbent&nbsp;managers in place, as long as incumbents credibly commit to continue investing&nbsp;in specific social or environmental issues. Activists can use nonconventional&nbsp;“voice” mechanisms - mounting a media campaign, threatening boycotts, or&nbsp;using their political clout - to support incumbents and fend off takeovers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The empirical studies that support the prosociality as entrenchment hypothesis— focus on operational profit sacrificing (as in moving to a greener&nbsp;production to appease environmental groups). For our purposes, the question is&nbsp;can managers gain personal favor with activists also by donating to charity?&nbsp;Anecdotal evidence suggests they can.<sup>75</sup> In the Minnesota anti-takeover bill, for&nbsp;example, Dayton Hudson’s CP policy was not merely touted as valuable; the&nbsp;incumbents also called upon the company’s grantees - apparently key players in&nbsp;the state - to help promote managerial lobbying efforts.— More generally, the&nbsp;CP-as-co-optation idea can explain why firms with independent boards donate&nbsp;more. If profit sacrificing is a managerial perk, then arguably managers who are&nbsp;monitored by independent boards should engage in it less. But if CP is not only&nbsp;self-aggrandizing but also entrenching, then managerial-driven CP should only&nbsp;increase when internal governance is stronger (e.g., when boards are more&nbsp;independent). Under a greater internal threat to their authority, managers need to&nbsp;invest more in maintaining influence (a demand-side explanation). Unregulated&nbsp;managerial discretion over prosocial expenditures is therefore more likely to be</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">used in such contexts as another tool to influence key players, whose support managers need more when threatened from within.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">*</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Throughout this book, our analysis has followed two steps: understanding how reputation works in a given market, and then examining how the law affects&nbsp;reputation. This chapter has focused thus far on the first prong: how reputational&nbsp;incentives push companies to engage in CP. We now move to the second prong:&nbsp;how the law shapes both the signaling and co-optation aspects of CP behavior.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark67"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark716"></a>5.5 How the Law Affects CP: the Case for&nbsp;Disclosure</span></h4>
<p><span class="font21">Legal systems across the world have afforded wide discretion to corporate managers to sacrifice profits in the public interest, while very few protective&nbsp;mechanisms apply. In the United States, for example, companies do not even&nbsp;have to disclose their CP activity. This legal treatment may have been a&nbsp;consequence of viewing the buying goodwill mechanism as extremely simple:&nbsp;companies donate because stakeholders like the fact that companies donate.&nbsp;Companies can increase profits by acting philanthropically, and if CP increases&nbsp;profits, then there is no need to intervene. Nonexistent legal regulation may also&nbsp;be a consequence of a simplified view of the critical accounts of CP as agency&nbsp;costs. The agency approach assumes that managers will always have some&nbsp;discretionary resources to spend as they wish, as totally eliminating agency costs&nbsp;is simply too costly (monitoring managers is imperfect). Given this level of&nbsp;discretionary resources at the managers’ disposal, it should be of no consequence&nbsp;to shareholder value whether managers choose to spend on their preferred&nbsp;charity or on traveling in luxurious company jets. Moreover, the understanding&nbsp;goes, these expenditures are insignificant in dollar terms and thus do not merit&nbsp;intervention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Yet once we introduce the CP-as-signaling and the CP-as-co-optation approaches, the case for some form of intervention - particularly, mandatory&nbsp;disclosure - becomes stronger. As this section shows, here as well, legal&nbsp;intervention can actually facilitate better reputational control of the positive and&nbsp;negative aspects of CP. Section 5.1.1 details the existing legal structure for&nbsp;regulating CP, in the United States and elsewhere. Section 5.1.2 then clarifies&nbsp;what we should not do, namely, ban CP. Section 5.1.3 provides the case for what&nbsp;we should do: implement some form of mandatory disclosure. Section 5.1.4&nbsp;offers some political economy thoughts on why past efforts to legislate&nbsp;disclosure requirements have failed.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark717"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark718"></a>5.5.1 The Existing Regime: a Regulatory Vacuum</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">The reputation-through-litigation story does not apply in the corporate niceness context, simply because there is very little litigation. In most developed&nbsp;countries, the law grants corporations the power to engage in philanthropy, and&nbsp;allows managers wide discretion in exercising this power.<sup>77</sup> Only rarely do&nbsp;shareholders challenge management’s decision to donate. When they do, the&nbsp;courts are quick to assume that managers decided to donate with some long-term&nbsp;benefit for the company in mind.<sup>78</sup> And donating to charity would not constitute&nbsp;“waste,” because managers can practically always justify profit sacrifices by&nbsp;alluding to some indirect benefit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">To the extent that the law affects reputational incentives to donate, it does so through a different channel: not litigation but rather disclosure rules. Some&nbsp;countries have installed detailed disclosure rules, requiring companies to reveal&nbsp;the amounts they donated, or the beneficiaries.— The United States, by contrast,&nbsp;does not subject CP to a specific disclosure requirement.— The only resemblance&nbsp;of disclosure requirements comes from private ordering: the top stock exchanges&nbsp;demand that a listed company that donates over a certain amount to a charity&nbsp;affiliated with an independent director disclose this contribution.— Yet such soft-law requirements are rarely enforced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The upshot is that CP practices exist in the United States in a regulatory vacuum. The laws evolved to grant wide discretion to sacrifice profits&nbsp;prosocially, without affording investors the means to control this discretion, such&nbsp;as by mandatory disclosure or a shareholder vote.<sup>82</sup> Armed with insights on the&nbsp;circumstances under which CP can be either good or bad for the company, we&nbsp;can now assess whether not regulating at all is optimal. Here as well, there are&nbsp;two layers to the optimality question: how the law affects behavior directly, by&nbsp;sanctioning certain behaviors, and how the law affects behavior indirectly, by&nbsp;producing information.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark719"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark720"></a>5.5.2 The Case against Banning CP</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">Would we be better off with a legal regime that directly intervenes and bans CP? The answer is clearly no. The body of literature studying the link between CP&nbsp;and the financial bottom line tells us there at the minimum there is no financial&nbsp;penalty for CP. A blanket legal ban cannot be justified on economic grounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The next option to consider is a targeted ban: sanctioning certain types of CP behaviors. After all, we saw that certain CP practices do not enhance&nbsp;company’s value but rather benefit managers at shareholders’ expense. Those&nbsp;opposing legal intervention frequently respond that, while some donations are&nbsp;indeed about managerial self-aggrandizement, those are only isolated cases of&nbsp;relatively small magnitude that do not merit intervention. Yet, </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Section 5.4</span><span class="font21"> shed&nbsp;light on the problems that arise from continuing to ignore CP. In the subset of&nbsp;cases in which managerial-driven CP not only reflects existing agency costs but&nbsp;also generates additional agency costs, the case for legal intervention is much&nbsp;stronger. Failure to address agency problems in CP decisions might make it&nbsp;more difficult to address agency problems in other corporate decisions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">But is it really feasible to target and ban those CP decisions that are bad for the company and allow all others? Probably not. Our discussion of the signaling&nbsp;benefits of CP highlights how a targeted ban may be impractical and&nbsp;unwarranted. Shareholders and courts will have a hard time distinguishing&nbsp;profit-enhancing from profit-reducing donations. Sacrificing profits may still be&nbsp;value enhancing, if it constitutes a handicap - a costly signal that mitigates&nbsp;asymmetric information. Attempting to eliminate bad CP decisions based on the&nbsp;existence of clear signs of quid pro quo, or professed insiders’ motivations, is&nbsp;therefore futile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Still, it is one thing to refrain from direct interference with CP decisions (as we should), and another to leave CP in a regulatory vacuum (as we should not).&nbsp;The optimal regulation of CP seems to be leaving profit-sacrificing discretion to&nbsp;managers, while helping the market check managerial discretion, by providing&nbsp;some form of mandatory disclosure.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark721"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark722"></a>5.5.3 The Case for Disclosure</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">The lack of any substantive disclosure requirement in the United States is not due to omission. Proposals for legislation have been brought up frequently in&nbsp;Congress and the corporate and securities law literature starting in the 1990s.—&nbsp;Yet those proposals, even the modest ones, never made it into law.<sup>84</sup> By delving&nbsp;into the legislative history of these proposed disclosure bills, we can distill the&nbsp;arguments made against disclosure into three categories: (1) the direct costs of&nbsp;implementing disclosure; (2) the expected chilling effect on overall CP; and (3)&nbsp;the marginal benefits of regulated disclosure - the relevant information is&nbsp;already public and/or no one is interested in it. A closer look reveals that all&nbsp;three arguments are shaky.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The first argument invokes the costs of compiling and disseminating data. Yet in practice, introducing a new disclosure requirement will not add&nbsp;significantly to the mix of costs already incurred. Firms are required to report the&nbsp;levels and targets of certain donations to the IRS, so no compiling costs would&nbsp;be added.<sup>85</sup> Since large firms disseminate information about their prosocial&nbsp;behavior to the public via company websites and separate, lengthy CSR reports,&nbsp;no disseminating costs will be added either.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The second argument suggests that disclosure will decrease the overall levels of CP. Managers will simply steer away from the unwanted distraction&nbsp;that may come with disclosure, and keep their CP engagement to minimum. Any&nbsp;benefits that shareholders may get from sunlight disinfecting bad CP decisions&nbsp;will be dwarfed by the negative impact that too much sun will have on the&nbsp;nonprofit sector. I elaborated elsewhere on why such chilling-effect argument is&nbsp;inconsistent with logic.<sup>86</sup> Let us focus here on why it is also inconsistent with&nbsp;evidence. While the United States never experienced mandatory CP disclosure,&nbsp;other countries had, and we can tap their experience for evidence on the real-world consequences of enacting disclosure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The Israeli experience, for example, suggests that requiring disclosure results in </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">ratcheting up</span><span class="font21"> CP levels rather than chilling them. In 2001, the Israeli&nbsp;Securities Authority (ISA) introduced a new reporting requirement, requiring&nbsp;firms to disclose in their annual reports (in the directors’ report section) the&nbsp;amount of money given to charities, as well as the strategy behind to whom did&nbsp;they donate. Following the new regulation, firms disclosed more and,&nbsp;importantly, actually donated more.<sup>87</sup> Further, media coverage of CP numbers&nbsp;and policies increased, and the first CSR ratings was established.<sup>88</sup> The head of&nbsp;the ISA summed its experience with CP reporting in retrospect thusly:&nbsp;“[mandating CP disclosure] promoted a ‘competition’ among publicly-traded&nbsp;firms, whereby they increased their social involvement.”—</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The UK experience completes the picture, by providing us with a glimpse into what happens when a country shifts from a mandatory- to a voluntary-disclosure regime. After the regulator dropped the mandatory disclosure&nbsp;requirement of CP in 2013, companies disclosed less, and, importantly, donated&nbsp;less.— Both the Israeli and the UK example suggest that requiring disclosure of&nbsp;CP actually ramps up, rather than chills, overall CP levels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The third recurring objection to requiring disclosure of CP posits that investors simply are not interested in information about CP, and those investors&nbsp;who are interested can assemble the relevant pieces of public information&nbsp;without needing regulatory intervention. In support of this claim, opponents of&nbsp;disclosure invoke the relative dearth of shareholder litigation and proposals on&nbsp;the matter. But all we can really conclude from such evidence is that&nbsp;shareholders are not interested in the information currently available. Naturally,&nbsp;the abuse of profit-sacrificing expenditures will not be disclosed voluntarily, so&nbsp;shareholders and regulators cannot act upon them </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">ex ante.</span><span class="font21"> A more relevant&nbsp;question is whether the managers of Enron and RJR Nabisco could have freely&nbsp;used CP as a co-optation device if there had been a disclosure requirement in&nbsp;place at the time.<sup>91</sup> And as for learning everything investors need to know from&nbsp;existing public reports, it is true that by now virtually all large companies&nbsp;generate detailed CSR reports, yet these reports achieve no real transparency.<sup>92&nbsp;</sup>In an uninformative “cheap talk” environment, practically all companies profess&nbsp;to be nice, and no manager professes to abuse CP money to entrench herself, so&nbsp;outsiders cannot distinguish between nice guys and pretenders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The upshot is that some form of regulated disclosure could better align CP practices with shareholder value. Firms cannot be expected to voluntarily&nbsp;provide sufficient and comparable information on their prosocial activities, due&nbsp;to agency and coordination problems.<sup>93</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Agency problems mean that, when left on their own, insiders will have incentives to provide biased disclosure, whether by exaggerating the positive&nbsp;aspects of donations or by camouflaging the negative aspects. Mandatory&nbsp;disclosure could serve as an early warning by flushing out cases of self-aggrandizement, as well as reducing the ability of managers to use CP as a co-optation device.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Coordination problems mean that when each firm makes its individual, voluntary disclosure decisions, it does not take into account the positive&nbsp;externalities that come from producing information that facilitates comparisons&nbsp;to other firms. Mandatory disclosure could standardize both the form and the&nbsp;substance of the information, thereby allowing comparing among different&nbsp;companies’ donations, and increasing the value of information to outsiders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">For all these reasons, I do not take the direct-costs objection, the chilling-effect objection, or the no-one-cares objection seriously. Yet there is another, valid objection to requiring CP disclosure, namely, the risk of </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">overwhelming&nbsp;investors with information.</span><span class="font21"> Proposing disclosure is too easy of a solution, for&nbsp;academics and policymakers alike, across all types of issues. As a result, the&nbsp;market is already bombarded with disclosure requirements of various kinds. At&nbsp;the same time, the attention span and cognitive capacities of intended audiences&nbsp;do not expand - they remain bounded. Therefore, any piece of added mandatory&nbsp;disclosure, even if valuable in end of itself, crowds out attention to an existing&nbsp;disclosure in another area, perhaps even more valuable. In other words, adding&nbsp;disclosure requirements come with negative externalities, which should be&nbsp;weighed against the presumed benefits of said disclosure.<sup>94</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Yet, acknowledging the already-existing flow of social responsibility information discredits the “information overload” argument as well. On the&nbsp;contrary, because the mass of public information is currently presented in a&nbsp;distorted, nonstandardized, and nontransparent manner (anecdotes instead of&nbsp;comparable numbers, forcing readers to wind through the maze of long CSR&nbsp;reports), any requirement that companies publicize a standardized and concise&nbsp;form, such as a single number of overall donations, will not muddy the waters&nbsp;but rather crystallize them.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark723"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark724"></a>5.5.4 How Come Disclosure Proposals Never Made It into Law?</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">Given that the commonly raised objections to disclosure do not have enough merit, why do proposals that would require disclosure of CP continue to be&nbsp;rejected? While this was not the original focus of my research, I came out with a&nbsp;surprising political economy story based on personal interviews I conducted, and&nbsp;reading congressional hearings: among those pushing against disclosure were the&nbsp;charitable organizations themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">While some nonprofit organizations publicly supported disclosure, leaders of the mainstream foundations and associations were vocal in their resistance.&nbsp;Publicly, they professed their concern that disclosure would yield a chilling&nbsp;effect (an objection we dismissed above). But perhaps there is a cynical flavor to&nbsp;their opposition: what those players care about might not be the level of overall&nbsp;CP, but rather the share of CP directed at their own specific nonprofits. They&nbsp;might fear that disclosure would hinder their advantage in influencing corporate&nbsp;insiders behind closed doors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">From the point of view of the third sector as a group, however, regulated disclosure would likely improve things. In the existing unregulated disclosure&nbsp;regime, companies that actually invest heavily in prosociality find it hard to&nbsp;distinguish themselves from those who merely pretend to be generous. This&nbsp;cheap-talk environment leads insiders to invest in marketing rather than actual&nbsp;philanthropic impact. In other words, prosocial activities are picked for their&nbsp;window-dressing value. Some form of regulated disclosure could lead to less&nbsp;cacophony, and less cacophony could lead to more incentives to engage in&nbsp;meaningful prosocial profit sacrificing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">*</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Overall, the corporate governance concerns raised by CP should not be overstated. There are other agency problems more urgent than misuse of&nbsp;prosocial discretion. The legal system does not need to interfere too much with&nbsp;existing practices. At the same time, misuses of CP could be indicative of&nbsp;agency problems and, when used in tandem with other co-optation devices,&nbsp;could generate agency problems. Introducing a limited form of the less&nbsp;restrictive protective mechanism - mandatory disclosure - may therefore be the&nbsp;best option. Whatever form of regulation is introduced, careful attention has to&nbsp;be paid to its expressive aspects. Intervention should be couched as not&nbsp;interfering with voluntary sacrifices and not taming corporate prosociality, so as&nbsp;not to crowd out motivations and erode benefits arising from signaling.<sup>95</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">*</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The argument against disclosure run into a common flaw that we have seen throughout this book in various context: not accounting enough for how laws&nbsp;affect reputational concerns. While corporate prosociality is very much a product&nbsp;of reputational incentives, these reputational forces do not operate in a vacuum.&nbsp;They are rather influenced by the existing legal regime. The law dictates the&nbsp;quantity and quality of information on CP activities. Without a background of&nbsp;legal standards governing prosocial disclosure, reputational forces are limited in&nbsp;their ability to ensure that companies engage meaningfully in prosocial activities&nbsp;and report accurately.<sup>96</sup> For reputational forces to work their magic, they need&nbsp;legal control of the flow of information. Particularly, they need a one-two punch:&nbsp;</span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">ex ante</span><span class="font21"> regulation requiring standardized reporting of form and substance, and </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">ex&nbsp;post</span><span class="font21"> liability threat for falsely communicating or failing to report. Injecting some&nbsp;form of legal control would increase the threat of reputational sanctions for&nbsp;managers abusing CP expenditures, as well as the promise of reputational&nbsp;rewards, allowing firms to credibly commit to prosociality with real impact.<sup>97</sup></span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark69"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark725"></a>5.6 Final Thoughts: Corporate Philanthropy&nbsp;as a Reputational Buffer</span></h4>
<p><span class="font21">While this chapter focused on how CSR helps companies reap reputational </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">rewards,</span><span class="font21"> much of the writing on CSR over the past decade has focused on the&nbsp;other side, namely, how CSR serves as a buffer against reputational </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">sanctions.&nbsp;</span><span class="font21">When stakeholders perceive company X as nice, they will give it the benefit of a&nbsp;doubt when bad news breaks, or so the argument goes. Recall the Odwalla&nbsp;contaminated juice story crisis from </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 2</span><span class="font21">: because the company had a&nbsp;preexisting image of a do-gooder, stakeholders believed that top management&nbsp;could not have prevented the harm, and the reputational fallout was initially&nbsp;contained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">However, careful studies have questioned the CSR-as-buffer argument. Prior nice-guy reputation works as a buffer only in limited scenarios. It may&nbsp;provide you with the initial benefit of a doubt, but it only lasts that long: if&nbsp;credible damning information about you comes out, it will violate stakeholders’&nbsp;high expectations from you, and the reputational sanction will actually be&nbsp;bigger.— Further, bad news about a nice company would attract more media&nbsp;coverage and NGOs, because of the man-bite-dog aspect to it.<sup>99</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">From our perspective, the interesting question is how the law shapes companies’ incentives to engage in CP to minimize reputation risk. We can point&nbsp;out three potential effects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">First, the legal system can shape the baseline tradeoffs, between investing in CP as a reputational buffer and reducing one’s legal and reputational risk in&nbsp;other ways. To illustrate, consider the case of a chemical company that stumbles&nbsp;upon a profitable-yet-dangerous chemical, and faces a choice between investing&nbsp;in abatement measures </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">ex ante,</span><span class="font21"> and investing in a nice-guy buffer that will&nbsp;supposedly limit the reputational fallout </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">ex post</span><span class="font21"> (once bad news about the&nbsp;pollution breaks).— The higher the expected legal sanction, the more the&nbsp;company has incentives to invest in actual abatement of pollution instead of&nbsp;buffering reputational fallouts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Second, the law can determine whether the nice-guy image serves as a buffer or more as an amplifier. When bad news breaks about a supposedly nice&nbsp;company, that company can build on its preexisting reputational cache and try to&nbsp;convince stakeholders to give it the benefit of a doubt. Yet, the sooner litigation&nbsp;and regulatory investigations start producing information about what and how&nbsp;things happened, the less this benefit of a doubt lasts, and the more likely it is&nbsp;that stakeholders will view what happened as a violation of their expectations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Finally and similarly to our analysis in </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Section 5.5</span><span class="font21">, the legal system affects the CP-as-buffer dynamics via disclosure rules. In a country with an effective&nbsp;disclosure regime, which facilitates standardization and comparisons, companies&nbsp;have incentives to go beyond mere appearance management and truly become&nbsp;more socially responsible, so as not to be exposed as hypocrite and have their&nbsp;investment in CP turns into a double-edged sword.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">You probably sense the overarching theme by now. In all three channels, when legal deterrence is nonexistent, appearance management becomes key; but&nbsp;when legal deterrence matters, appearance management is not enough. In other&nbsp;words, the more effective legal deterrence is, the less effective CSR becomes as&nbsp;a window-dressing reputational buffer.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Regulators' Reputation</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark72"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark822"></a>6.1 Introduction</span></h4>
<p><span class="font21">Can judicial review effectively check regulators’ behaviors? The answer largely depends on how regulators behave - what motivates them. If, as in traditional&nbsp;economic theory, regulators mostly maximize their narrow self-interest, then&nbsp;there is little that judicial review can do to stop regulatory capture. Judges may&nbsp;invalidate specific regulatory decisions after the fact, but they cannot overcome&nbsp;the inherent advantages that special interests enjoy in the way of offering&nbsp;lucrative future business opportunities or campaign financing. If, however,&nbsp;regulators care not just about material incentives, but also about their reputation,&nbsp;then judicial review can shape regulators’ behavior indirectly, by providing&nbsp;information on how regulators behave. Regardless of whether courts intervene&nbsp;and strike down specific regulatory decisions or not, the process of litigation can&nbsp;generate reputational pressures that propel the regulators to change their&nbsp;behavior. Judicial review mitigates the risks of regulatory capture not so much&nbsp;through modifying regulators’ material incentives, but rather through </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">shaping&nbsp;the public 's perceptions of regulators.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">In other words, the gist of this book’s main argument applies not just in the context of corporate reputation, but also in the context of regulators’ reputation.&nbsp;A burgeoning political science literature empirically documents that regulators&nbsp;care about reputation and proactively react to what the media writes about them.&nbsp;With this literature as our background, we can ask the prior question, of what&nbsp;shapes the media agenda. What regulatory issues the media will cover? How it&nbsp;will cover them? In the regulatory arena, much like in the business world, a large&nbsp;part of the answer is the legal system. Litigation produces information that&nbsp;shapes what we think about regulators.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The most intuitive channel for information about regulators is administrative litigation, which implicates regulatory behavior directly, as in&nbsp;requiring the regulator to provide detailed explanations for why she decided the&nbsp;way she did. A less intuitive channel is private litigation, which implicates&nbsp;regulatory behavior indirectly, as in when a tort law defendant raises the&nbsp;regulatory compliance defense, and turns the trial into a referendum on the&nbsp;regulator’s standard-setting abilities. Information from litigation mitigates the&nbsp;asymmetries that usually exist between the well-informed special interest groups&nbsp;and the hitherto-uninformed dispersed public. It thereby helps the public shame&nbsp;regulators into standing up to powerful interests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">This chapter proceeds in five sections. </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Section 6.2</span><span class="font21"> synthesizes insights from the burgeoning literature on regulators’ reputation concerns. The section&nbsp;explains why the fact that regulators care about reputation does not necessarily&nbsp;mean that they will do a better job in protecting the public interest. There exists&nbsp;an asymmetric monitoring problem: special interest groups are better at&nbsp;monitoring regulators’ behaviors and spotlighting mistakes against them, while&nbsp;the dispersed public is often unaware or unable to spotlight mistakes. As a result,&nbsp;counterintuitively, a regulator who cares about her reputation will tend to err on&nbsp;the side of the regulated industry and against the public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Section 6.3</span><span class="font21"> argues that judicial review mitigates the asymmetric monitoring problem, therefore reducing the risk of regulatory capture. The section&nbsp;emphasizes the importance of reason-giving requirements in facilitating bottom-up monitoring of regulators. At the same time, public litigation is more limited&nbsp;in its ability to affect change via reputational pressures than private litigation, for&nbsp;various reasons that the section details. In most circumstances, then, reputational&nbsp;pressures on regulators will have to come from elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">This is where </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Section 6.4</span><span class="font21"> enters, extending the argument by focusing on how private litigation (to which the regulator is not even privy) can affect the</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">regulator’s reputation, pushing her to promote the public interest. </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Section 6.4 </span><span class="font21">maps typical scenarios where private litigants have incentives to generate&nbsp;information that implicates the regulators’ behavior. The section then revisits the&nbsp;“regulation through litigation” literature, by emphasizing the distinction between&nbsp;information-producing and reputation-shaping effects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Section 6.5</span><span class="font21"> sketches policy implications, such as identifying the types of cases where judicial activism makes more sense. </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Section 6.6</span><span class="font21"> finishes with big-picture observations on the differences between the reputational effects of public&nbsp;law litigation and those of private law litigation.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark74"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark823"></a>6.2 Regulators' Reputation Concerns</span></h4>
<p><span class="font21">We can define regulators’ reputation in similar fashion to how we defined corporate reputation: the set of beliefs that the regulator’s audiences hold&nbsp;regarding her capabilities, performances, and roles.<sup>1</sup> The political science&nbsp;literature examines the questions of </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">whether</span><span class="font21"> regulators care about their&nbsp;reputation (they do), </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">why</span><span class="font21"> they care about it (because it helps them secure&nbsp;autonomy and power), and </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">how</span><span class="font21"> they manage it (by prioritizing salient threats).&nbsp;Yet we still know relatively little about the “so what” question: does the fact that&nbsp;regulators care about reputation mean that they will be more effective,&nbsp;promoting the public interest? Does reputational deterrence work in the&nbsp;regulatory context? This section provides reasons for skepticism. Regulators’&nbsp;reputations may be too noisy and detached from reality to provide optimal&nbsp;deterrence. A regulator who cares about her reputation will not necessarily do a&nbsp;better job promoting the public interest.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark824"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark825"></a>6.2.1 Regulators Care about Reputation</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">Answering the first question - </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">whether</span><span class="font21"> regulators care about reputation - is straightforward: yes. Very much so. With the exception of a few public choice&nbsp;accounts,<sup>2</sup> by now most political scientists acknowledge that regulators care&nbsp;about more than just their narrow self-interest. Regulators want to do a good job.&nbsp;And they want to be </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">perceived</span><span class="font21"> as doing a good job.<sup>3</sup> When deciding how to&nbsp;design, implement, and enforce policy, regulators frequently consider&nbsp;appearances. They think strategically about how their decisions will be&nbsp;perceived by the politicians who appoint them, the public whose interests they&nbsp;are supposed to protect, the industry whom they are supposed to monitor, and so&nbsp;on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">A fast-emerging literature dubbed BRT (for “bureaucratic reputation theory”) has shifted attention to the second question, namely, </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">how</span><span class="font21"> regulators&nbsp;care about reputation. The BRT literature empirically documents how regulators&nbsp;proactively manage their reputations, and prioritize their responses to external&nbsp;signals/criticisms.</span><span class="font16">4 </span><span class="font21">For example, some studies show that regulators react&nbsp;differently based on the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">content</span><span class="font21"> of the allegations they are facing: prioritizing&nbsp;allegations of under-regulating over allegations of over-regulating.</span><span class="font16">5 </span><span class="font21">Other&nbsp;studies show that regulators react differently based on the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">visibility</span><span class="font21"> of&nbsp;allegations: they prioritize addressing criticisms that make it to front-page media&nbsp;coverage.<sup>6</sup> The BRT literature also documents the arsenal that regulators employ&nbsp;in managing their reputation: they can react to external threats by changing their&nbsp;enforcement decisions, or by changing their communication strategy. Within&nbsp;their communication strategy, under certain conditions regulators respond to&nbsp;allegations by keeping silent, while under other conditions they are more likely&nbsp;to openly address allegations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">We can also tap the BRT literature for insights on the third question, namely, </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">why</span><span class="font21"> exactly regulators care so much about reputation. Regulators&nbsp;carefully manage their reputation not just due to concerns about higher prestige&nbsp;and status. A good reputation provides regulators with more autonomy and&nbsp;discretion.</span><span class="font16">7 </span><span class="font21">It buffers them from political attacks, and helps them secure higher&nbsp;budgets.</span><span class="font16">8 </span><span class="font21">After all, politicians are more likely to vest resources and authority in&nbsp;regulators who are perceived to be expert and effective. Further, an agency that&nbsp;enjoys a good reputation can recruit and retain higher-quality public servants.&nbsp;And an individual regulator who enjoys good reputation is more likely to secure&nbsp;promotions. Good reputation also helps regulators with their interactions with&nbsp;the industry they are supposed to regulate or the consumer groups they are meant&nbsp;to protect.</span><span class="font16">9</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Still, one interesting question remains understudied: what does it mean that regulators care about their reputation? How do regulators’ reputation concerns&nbsp;affect regulatory behavior? Political scientists too often allude to regulators’&nbsp;reputation concerns positively, as a trump card against arguments of regulatory&nbsp;capture.<sup>10</sup> These scholars </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">assume</span><span class="font21"> that the need to maintain a good reputation&nbsp;imposes discipline on regulators. A regulator who cares about her reputation&nbsp;would think twice before conceding to special interests, out of fear that the deal&nbsp;she strikes with them will be exposed and her reputation lost, or so the argument&nbsp;goes. Regulators are aware of the old adage: it takes years to build a strong&nbsp;reputation, but one revealed misbehavior to destroy it. As a result, they will be&nbsp;extra careful about catering to special interests, because one piece of bad news&nbsp;may irreversibly damage their reputation.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Such reputation-concerns-cure-all argument is flawed. It is one thing to acknowledge that regulators care about reputation, and another to assume that&nbsp;reputational concerns push regulators toward the public interest. As the previous&nbsp;chapters showed, in commercial markets reputations are too often noisy and fail&nbsp;to deter misbehavior or reward good behavior. Similar dynamics are in play in&nbsp;the regulatory context, albeit with some interesting twists.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark826"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark827"></a>6.2.2 Regulators’ Reputations Are Noisy</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">Regulators’ reputations are noisy. A regulator could promote the public interest and get a bad reputation, or cater to special interests and get a good reputation.&nbsp;As a result, reputational concerns do not necessarily promote better regulatory&nbsp;behavior. A responsive regulator does not always respond to the right signals.&nbsp;The same basic flaws that plague the process of reputational judgments in other&nbsp;contexts appear in the regulatory context as well, and with a vengeance.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark828"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark829"></a>6.2.2.1 Players Who Dispense Reputational Sanctions</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">When we think about policymakers’ target audiences, we normally think about the public: the classic reputational sanction in politics would be voting you out if&nbsp;you did not meet expectations. On paper, the fear of not being reelected or&nbsp;reappointed should drive regulators to cater to voters’ preferences. Yet in reality,&nbsp;voters often lack the information necessary to judge whether economic&nbsp;regulators “misbehaved.”— Voters do not have the ability or incentives to keep&nbsp;themselves informed. In a modern-day economy, the apparatus of&nbsp;socioeconomic regulation is all encompassing, detailed, and complex. For the&nbsp;average citizen, remaining informed on whether regulator X did a good job or&nbsp;not is a Herculean task. Remaining </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">wn</span><span class="font21">informed is actually the rational thing to&nbsp;do: while the public as a whole benefit if the polity is informed enough to keep&nbsp;decision makers honest, the private costs of becoming informed dwarf the&nbsp;private benefits. This is the famous </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">rational ignorance</span><span class="font21"> problem.<sup>13</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">In fact, in political markets the problem may be more severe. In commercial markets, misjudging reputations can come back to haunt you immediately, as in&nbsp;buying from a shady company or not buying from a great company. In politics,&nbsp;by contrast, you have very little skin in the game. Each voter knows that her&nbsp;single vote is not likely to sway policies. To use Bryan Caplan’s terminology,&nbsp;voters suffer not just from rational ignorance but also from rational&nbsp;</span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">irrationality.—</span><span class="font21"> That is, voters feel free to indulge their biases when collecting&nbsp;information and voting on policies: I can vote with my favorite team, regardless&nbsp;of whether this team offers the best policies. A voter would feel free to identify&nbsp;certain bad policy choices as praiseworthy and good policy choices as&nbsp;blameworthy, and not suffer the consequences of misjudging.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">A different type of target audience is the elected officials who appoint regulators. Ministers are arguably much better informed than the average voter&nbsp;is. Yet politicians, too, often lack the proper information and expertise to judge&nbsp;regulators’ reputation effectively. After all, informational and expertise problems&nbsp;push politicians to delegate policy to professional bureaucrats to begin with. The&nbsp;same problems would likely hinder the ability of politicians to monitor&nbsp;professional bureaucrats after the fact.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark830"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark831"></a>6.2.2.2 Players Who Facilitate Reputational Sanctions (Information&nbsp;Intermediaries)</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">In the political realm, the relevant information intermediaries (those who select, certify, and diffuse information on regulatory behavior) usually fall into two&nbsp;categories: mass media and interest groups. On paper, both have better access to&nbsp;information and more expertise than the public. Yet evidence shows that both&nbsp;rarely cover the meaningful aspects of regulatory behavior, or cover them in a&nbsp;slanted way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Much like media coverage of big business, media scrutiny of big government is slanted due to dependence on sources and advertisers.— Even if&nbsp;journalists manage to overcome their own biases and lack of expertise, they still&nbsp;need to cater to their readers’ (-voters) biases. Voters are interested in topics that&nbsp;are vivid and discernable, and opinions that fit their own priors.<sup>16</sup> Media scrutiny&nbsp;of regulatory behavior is therefore very selective - the media picks its battles&nbsp;according to entertainment value and not according to the issue’s real impact on&nbsp;society.<sup>17</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Importantly, media coverage of regulatory issues is slanted in hidden ways. The problem is not so much with how the media covers a certain regulatory&nbsp;issue, but with all the issues that the media does not cover.<sup>18</sup> Major regulatory&nbsp;agencies, even those that preside over huge budgets and responsibilities, often do&nbsp;not have any reporter assigned to their beat (i.e., no one covers them&nbsp;regularly).— This media-slant-by-omission problem represents a key weakness&nbsp;in the BRT literature: existing studies document how regulators react to what the&nbsp;media covers, but they do not (cannot) document what the media does not cover.&nbsp;To better understand how reputational concerns shape regulatory behavior we&nbsp;first need to understand who sets the media agenda: who and what makes certain&nbsp;regulatory behaviors more vivid and coverable for the media. (Without&nbsp;forecasting too much, a large part of the answer is litigation.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The other type of information intermediary that can facilitate reputational sanctions for regulators are interest groups. Yet not all interest groups are&nbsp;created equal. Narrow-interest groups are better at squawking when a regulator&nbsp;is about to hurt their interests than public interest groups are.<sup>20</sup> Certain types of&nbsp;information on regulatory behavior tend to be more immediately and widely&nbsp;diffused than others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The example of regulating rates of return illustrates.<sup>21</sup> When regulators wish to prevent monopolies from overpricing consumers, they sometimes set a&nbsp;maximum price, based on a formula of the costs to the monopolist firm. On&nbsp;paper, whenever the costs change, the regulator should update the allowed rate&nbsp;of return. In reality, there is an asymmetry: whenever the costs go up, regulated&nbsp;entities trigger a review, and the regulator updates the rate of return upwards. By&nbsp;contrast, when the costs go down, no one triggers an update of the maximum rate&nbsp;of return. In Israel, for example, regulators set in the mid-1990s a rate-of-return&nbsp;formula across sectors, at a time when the general interest rate was in double&nbsp;digits. When the interest rate dropped to 1 percent in the 2000s, no one triggered&nbsp;an update of the formula, rendering price controls completely ineffective.<sup>22</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The upshot is that, beyond the asymmetric information problem we recognized earlier, there is also an </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">asymmetric monitoring</span><span class="font21"> problem. Some&nbsp;groups monitor the regulator’s behavior more diligently.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Recognizing asymmetric monitoring dynamics leads to a counterintuitive and troubling conclusion: a regulator who cares about her reputation would tend&nbsp;to err in favor of the industry and against the public interest. To see why,&nbsp;imagine that you are a publicly spirted regulator. You know that you are bound&nbsp;to make mistakes at some point, given the complexity and uncertainty inherent&nbsp;in modern markets. The question you are asking yourself is how the outside&nbsp;world will perceive my mistakes. Will they spotlight, remember, and hold the&nbsp;mistakes against me? Or will they ignore and forget them? You quickly realize&nbsp;that mistakes against the regulated entities are immediately noticed by an army&nbsp;of dedicated and expert industry people; while mistakes against the public&nbsp;seldom get noticed.<sup>23</sup> To paraphrase the philosophical question about a tree&nbsp;falling in the forest when no one is around (did it really make a sound?): if a&nbsp;regulator makes a mistake at the expense of the diffuse public, did she really hurt&nbsp;her reputation? Erring in favor of the regulated industry minimizes the chances&nbsp;that people will notice your (real or perceived) mistakes, saving you from&nbsp;criticism.—</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark832"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark833"></a>6.2.2.3 Players Who Suffer Reputational Sanctions (the Regulators)</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">The BRT literature shows that regulators do not take expected reputational sanctions as given. They rather proactively manage the information environment&nbsp;to make themselves appear better than they truly are. For instance, one study&nbsp;shows that regulators prioritize responding to the more </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">visible</span><span class="font21"> criticisms. A&nbsp;regulator will prioritize responding to a marginal issue covered in the front&nbsp;pages, even at the expense of more important issue covered only at the back&nbsp;pages.<sup>25</sup> Another study finds that regulators fight off reputational threats with&nbsp;communication strategies (what they say) rather than with actions (what they&nbsp;actually do). They would rather talk their way out of criticism. Yet another study&nbsp;shows that regulators who face reputational pressures simply choose less visible&nbsp;ways to concede to special interests (but concede nevertheless).<sup>26</sup> In other words,&nbsp;regulators take care of what is risky for regulators; not necessarily what is risky&nbsp;for society.<sup>27</sup> Regulators’ ability to manage the information environment reduces&nbsp;the effectiveness of reputational deterrence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">*</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The bottom line will sound familiar to readers of the previous chapters: when left on its own, the market for regulators’ reputation is too flawed to consistently&nbsp;deter misbehavior. Yet in reality, the market for regulators’ reputation is rarely&nbsp;left alone. Litigation - both public and private - generates credible information&nbsp;on how regulators behave. The next two sections elaborate.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark76"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark834"></a>6.3 How Judicial Review Impacts&nbsp;Regulators' Reputation</span></h4>
<p><span class="font21">The administrative law literature tends to focus on what courts do - whether they interfere with regulatory decisions or not - rather than on how regulators react—&nbsp;To answer how regulators react, one needs a developed theory of how regulators&nbsp;behave, including how reputational concerns affect regulators. If we merge the&nbsp;insights from the BRT literature (on how reputation matters for regulators), with&nbsp;the insights developed thus far in this book (on how litigation affects reputation),&nbsp;we get a part of the answer: regulators anticipate that being challenged in court,&nbsp;regardless of the legal outcome, may alter what their audiences think about them.&nbsp;Judicial review therefore affects regulators not just by modifying their material&nbsp;incentives (as in conventional economic analysis), but also by shaping the&nbsp;public’s perceptions of them.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark835"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark836"></a>6.3.1 The Basic Story</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">Judicial review can mitigate several of the problems that plague the market for regulators’ reputation: it can provide the public with information on regulatory&nbsp;decision-making to which they were not privy; level the playing field between&nbsp;public-interest groups and narrow-interest groups; and reset the media agenda,&nbsp;facilitating coverage of meaningful issues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">At the most basic level, judicial review helps mitigating the asymmetric information problem. Nowhere is this more evident than with </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">reason-giving&nbsp;requirements.</span><span class="font21"> These requirements force regulators to reveal what exactly they&nbsp;decided, and why they decided that way. Indeed, judicial review has become&nbsp;“the principal tool for prompting agencies to undertake reason-giving.”<sup>29</sup> Courts&nbsp;shifted over the years from merely requiring regulators to provide reasons for the&nbsp;record, to giving the provided reasons a </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">hard look:</span><span class="font21"> digging into whether the&nbsp;reasons are adequate, whether the methods used to acquire evidence are reliable,&nbsp;whether agencies dully considered all contrary evidence, and so on.<sup>30</sup> As a&nbsp;byproduct, the public gets an expert opinion on whether regulators are doing&nbsp;their job properly.<sup>31</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The existing literature emphasizes three types of justifications for reason-giving requirements:<sup>32</sup> (1) bolstering “the legitimacy of government action”; (2) facilitating legal review of the decision after the fact; and (3) promoting internal&nbsp;reflection by the decision maker before the fact. We can now add another,&nbsp;nonexclusive, justification: (4) reason giving facilitates bottom-up, </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">reputational&nbsp;</span><span class="font21">monitoring of regulators.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">By making regulators publicize their reasoning in detail, courts make it easier for civic society to assess, debate, and hold regulators accountable.<sup>33</sup> A&nbsp;good example comes from judicial review of national security decisions. There,&nbsp;the court forced regulators to spell out in public the criteria for when and how&nbsp;they decide to transfer detainees to other countries, or target US citizens&nbsp;overseas.— Court-imposed disclosure made these decisions explicit and&nbsp;accessible, providing “a baseline against which ... the public may evaluate&nbsp;future executive behavior and challenge that behavior when it appears to&nbsp;countermand the stated policy.”—</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Judicial review also mitigates the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">asymmetric monitoring</span><span class="font21"> problem. That is, judicial review allows public-interest groups to more readily mobilize the masses&nbsp;against bad regulation. Public-interest groups can more easily spot damning&nbsp;information about regulatory behavior through the litigation process, than they&nbsp;can through the political process.<sup>36</sup> As one staff attorney in an environmentalist&nbsp;NGO told me: “so much of what the EPA does is opaque. So, even though [you&nbsp;can see that the] outcomes favor industry, the process of the EPA looks&nbsp;reasonable. Only litigation can pull out [and help you identify] the unreasonable&nbsp;aspects of regulator behavior.”<sup>37</sup> Further, if a regulator ignores input from&nbsp;public-interest groups during the political process, the court will force her to&nbsp;explain why she did so after the fact.<sup>38</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">In that way, judicial review makes the regulator’s favoritism more visible. The increased visibility, in turn, makes it easier for public-interest groups to&nbsp;enlist the help of donors, volunteers, and citizens who are normally disengaged.&nbsp;We have seen this story in previous chapters, in the commercial context:&nbsp;litigation does not just reveal new information, but also increases the saliency&nbsp;and shapes the framing of existing pieces of information. As one commentator&nbsp;noted in the context of judicial review of school segregation policies: “The&nbsp;courts have helped politicize issues that otherwise might have remained&nbsp;unattended.”<sup>39</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">To appreciate the reputational impact of judicial review, we can follow the path of previous chapters, and look at how litigation shapes media coverage of&nbsp;regulators. Judicial review provides journalists information subsidies, as in&nbsp;ready-made versions of why the regulator took a certain decision, or detailed&nbsp;assessments of how that decision should affect the readers. Judicial review&nbsp;thereby reduces the costs for journalists of covering bad aspects of regulators’&nbsp;behavior. It puts hitherto-ignored regulatory issues on the media and public&nbsp;agendas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">To illustrate, consider the 1995 Pulitzer-winning story of disability pension abuse by the Long Island police. There, the abuse of disability pension benefits&nbsp;has been going on for decades, while the political establishment was “unwilling&nbsp;to clash with the well-organized and well-financed police-union lobby, which&nbsp;pushes for more generous policy benefits while helping to finance politicians’&nbsp;campaigns and delivering coveted endorsements.”— To use a famous political&nbsp;economy typology, the problem was of the concentrated-benefits, dispersed-costs kind:<sup>41</sup> A powerful interest group enjoyed benefits at the expense of&nbsp;taxpayers. Those with the power to monitor and stop the abuse had no interest in&nbsp;fighting the powerful group on an issue that is far from the public’s eye. As an&nbsp;insider later confessed: “I think the big problem with the system is there’s not&nbsp;always someone on the other side.”— Then, investigative reporters from&nbsp;</span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Newsday</span><span class="font21"> exposed the abuse, and their story reverberated. The increased saliency&nbsp;immediately pushed the regulators to step up and stop the abuse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The most important part in this story, at least from our perspective, is what facilitated the journalistic exposé. The </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Newsday</span><span class="font21"> reporters could not have&nbsp;generated such an impactful story without having access to information form&nbsp;litigation. They culled court documents from tort litigation involving the&nbsp;supposed victims, showing that they were undeserving of the benefits they&nbsp;extracted. The causal chain worked thusly: litigation produces (as a byproduct)&nbsp;information on a neglected regulatory issue; the media picks up the information,&nbsp;packages it compellingly, and diffuses it widely, thereby putting the issue on the&nbsp;public agenda; and regulators react to the potential public backlash by taking&nbsp;care of the hitherto-neglected problem. “Where the public is ignorant of certain&nbsp;conditions, and political elites do not want to deal with them” the litigation&nbsp;process can change the political agenda, prioritizing hitherto unattended topics.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Beyond increasing the saliency of a given issue, judicial review can also </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">reduce the complexity</span><span class="font21"> of the issue at hand. As Emily Hammond Meazell&nbsp;suggested in the context of regulatory scientific determinations, a key function of&nbsp;judicial review is translating highly specialized information into a generalist&nbsp;account that even nonprofessionals can follow.— Judicial review thereby makes&nbsp;a complex issue more understandable and coverable by the media. Political&nbsp;scientists have long recognized that regulatory enforcement tends to drift away&nbsp;from the public interest in issues with low saliency and high complexity.<sup>45</sup> When&nbsp;courts increase the saliency and reduce the complexity, they therefore reduce the&nbsp;risk of regulatory capture.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark837"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark838"></a>6.3.2 Refining the Basic Story: Limitations</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">Thus far, we have kept the story neat: public litigation produces information on how regulators behave, and the information translates into reputational pressures&nbsp;that push regulators to behave better. Yet in reality, the reputation-through-litigation dynamics are limited in the public litigation arena much more than they&nbsp;are in private litigation. This section elaborates on the unique limitations of&nbsp;public litigation, and then points to alternative channels, such as torts against the&nbsp;government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Several of the limitations we covered in earlier chapters, in the context of corporate litigation, apply also here. Take for instance the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">time lag</span><span class="font21"> problem: If a&nbsp;regulator’s tenure is three years and the judicial process takes four years to get&nbsp;going, then the threat of reputation-through-litigation is not as deterring.&nbsp;Similarly, just like private litigation, there are types of biases that public&nbsp;litigation simply cannot fix, such as voters’ irrationality, or the media’s&nbsp;dependence on advertising dollars. We will not rehash the similar limitations&nbsp;here, but instead focus on three limitations that are unique to public law&nbsp;litigation: the ideological bent of judges, the ability of regulators to sidestep&nbsp;court-induced reputational pressures, and the ability of the industry to use court-induced reputational pressures as an influence mechanism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">First, the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">politicization of judicial review muddles the signal</span><span class="font21"> it sends. One well-established empirical pattern of judicial review is its ideological bent.—&nbsp;When judges decide whether to interfere with agency action, they are affected by&nbsp;their own personal political preferences. A conservative judge is more likely to&nbsp;vote down liberal agency actions, and vice versa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The politicization of judicial review presents a challenge to our reputational argument, because politicization muddles the signal that litigation generates. If&nbsp;audiences observe a judge criticizing and overturning a regulator’s decision, they&nbsp;would not necessarily view it as indicative of the regulator being incompetent or&nbsp;captured. They could instead attribute the criticism to the judge’s own political&nbsp;preferences. Perhaps the regulator was promoting what she believes is the public&nbsp;interest, and it just happens to be the opposite of what the judge believes the&nbsp;public interest is. Private litigation can facilitate reputational control even when&nbsp;judges are biased, simply because the main impact comes from the process itself&nbsp;rather than the final verdict. In other words, the process of (private) litigation&nbsp;tends to generate relative objective documentation, regardless of the judge’s&nbsp;subjectively tilted interpretations. Yet public litigants do not enjoy the same&nbsp;information-extracting powers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">A second problem with reputation-through-</span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">publzc</span><span class="font21">-litigation is that </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">regulators may respond only symbolically or too aggressively.</span><span class="font21"> The BRT&nbsp;literature has established that regulators proactively manage their reputation. It is&nbsp;therefore safe to assume that when faced with court-generated reputational&nbsp;pressures, regulators will not stand idle but rather attempt to dilute the expected&nbsp;reputational sanction. Regulators may choose courses of action that are less&nbsp;likely to be reviewed in court to begin with.<sup>47</sup> In cases where they are&nbsp;nevertheless challenged in court, regulators may engage in damage control by&nbsp;responding in a symbolic manner, weathering the storm without making&nbsp;substantive changes.<sup>48</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">To illustrate, let us recast the example of criticism directed at the SEC in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. You may recall from </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 4</span><span class="font21"> that the&nbsp;SEC responded to the public backlash by announcing a change in policy,&nbsp;committing to demanding more admissions in future settlements. Initially, it&nbsp;seemed that the court-generated reputational pressures worked. Then evidence&nbsp;started surfacing, suggesting that the new policy did not substantively address&nbsp;the criticism. In other words, the professed change of policy could have very&nbsp;well quieted down the public outcry without meaningfully improving the actual&nbsp;outcomes of SEC enforcement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">At the same time, I do not wish to overstate the co-opting-reputational-pressures limitation. Even symbolic responses and “cheap talk” commitments may represent a step in the right direction. They “shape citizens’ expectations&nbsp;from government and expose bureaucracies to external scrutiny when their&nbsp;performance falls short of expectations.”<sup>49</sup> To go back to our example: while it&nbsp;is true that the SEC can ramp up the number of admissions in small cases, we&nbsp;saw in </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 4</span><span class="font21"> that its commitment to change has also generated meaningful&nbsp;admissions in several impactful cases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Another possibility that may limit the positive reputational effects of litigation is that regulators will </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">overreact</span><span class="font21"> to court-generated reputational&nbsp;pressures. The logic here is intuitive: once bad news breaks, media coverage&nbsp;tends to gravitate toward the sensational and negative, looking for a villain. Such&nbsp;coverage may push regulators to engage in overkill. A good illustration comes&nbsp;from the breast implants litigation. There, litigation had the media pointing&nbsp;fingers at the FDA, which reacted by banning breast implants altogether. Many&nbsp;critics suggested that the FDA’s decision, at the time, was bad science (based on&nbsp;one piece of unsubstantiated evidence that surfaced in litigation) and bad policy,&nbsp;driven by the regulator’s desire to appease raging media scrutiny and public&nbsp;opinion.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Here as well, I do not wish to overstate the point. Yes, the risk of litigation-driven media coverage pushing regulators to overreact is real. But when all things are considered, it seems that instances where regulators over-regulate due&nbsp;to media scrutiny balance out with many cases where the watchdog did not bark,&nbsp;and regulators ended up under-regulating because the issue remained under the&nbsp;public’s radar. To go back to the breast implants example, litigation helped&nbsp;breaking a decade-plus cycle of regulatory inaction. Before litigation-driven&nbsp;pressures pushed the FDA to err on the side of aggressively regulating breast&nbsp;implants, the FDA had been erring for more than a decade on the side of&nbsp;regulating too laxly, not pushing the industry to test the safety of their products&nbsp;as required.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Finally, another problem with reputation-through-</span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">^u^lic</span><span class="font21">-litigation is that </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">the regulated industry itself often uses litigation as a lever.</span><span class="font21"> Challenging&nbsp;regulatory action in courts requires resources: time, money, and expertise.&nbsp;Special interest groups usually have more of these resources, and are therefore&nbsp;better at employing the judicial review channel in their favor, relative to the&nbsp;dispersed public.— Applied here, one could argue that court-generated&nbsp;reputational pressures are simply another mechanism used by special interest to&nbsp;capture regulators. A part of the problem, rather than the solution. To recast the&nbsp;tobacco litigation example: there, the industry sued the EPA, arguing that the&nbsp;regulator relied on junk science and became too trigger-happy.— A recent (rare)&nbsp;empirical study of the reputational effects of judicial review indeed focuses on&nbsp;how the regulated industry in Spain and in the UK uses legal challenges as a&nbsp;strategic resource, to gain favorable policies.<sup>54</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The main premise of this argument is valid: the regulated industry is, indeed, likely to try to use judicial review as a lever. But it does not follow that&nbsp;our point is mute: judicial review will, nevertheless, generate positive&nbsp;reputational momentum. To understand why, consider another stylized fact from&nbsp;the BRT literature: it is better for regulators’ reputation to be perceived as over-regulating, than to be perceived as under-regulating. Once a certain regulatory&nbsp;issue becomes salient, the regulators will be less worried about appearing to be&nbsp;populists on the issue (over-regulating), and more worried about appearing to be&nbsp;in the industry’s pocket (under-regulating). Applied here, we can assume that the&nbsp;reputational vector generated by industry-driven judicial review would be&nbsp;weaker than the reputational vector generated by public-interest-group-driven&nbsp;judicial review.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark839"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark840"></a>6.3.3 Torts against the Government</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">Torts against the government are another type of litigation that produces quality information on regulators’ behavior, and actually avoids some of the&nbsp;abovementioned limitations of administrative litigation. A good starting point to&nbsp;illustrate would be Daryl Levinson’s skepticism regarding constitutional torts.<sup>55&nbsp;</sup>Levinson maintains that deterrence does not work in tort claims against the&nbsp;government, because those who ultimately pay damages are us taxpayers, rather&nbsp;than the negligent regulators themselves. What Levinson misses is that making&nbsp;someone pay legal sanctions out of pocket is not the only way to deter.&nbsp;Litigation can deter regulators also by making them suffer </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">non</span><span class="font21">legal sanctions.&nbsp;Myriam Gilles’s account of the information-producing function of municipal&nbsp;liability suits provides a case in point, and maps nicely into our argument here.<sup>56&nbsp;</sup>Constitutional tort victims wishing to hold municipalities liable cannot rely&nbsp;on vicarious liability, but rather have to show a consistent policy or custom,&nbsp;Gilles shows.<sup>57</sup> As a result, constitutional tort victims usually try to unearth&nbsp;evidence of deliberate indifference, repeat offending, or a general problematic&nbsp;attitude on part of the municipal police force. This is exactly the type of&nbsp;information that is relevant to reputation judgments: it speaks to the&nbsp;intentionality and preventability of past behavior and is indicative of future&nbsp;behavior. Such claims are also likely to attract media attention, as they typically&nbsp;implicate high-profile social issues such as police brutality or government cover-ups.<sup>58</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">In all, if we map Gilles’s analysis of municipal liability suits onto </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter </span><span class="font21">1’s analysis of how information translates into reputation, we can conclude that&nbsp;torts against the government often increase the likelihood that information will&nbsp;be properly attributed and widely diffused, thereby increasing the effectiveness&nbsp;of reputational deterrence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">*</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The main gist of the reputation-through-litigation argument applies in public litigation as well. At the same time, the reputational dynamics seem to be less&nbsp;powerful here, compared to private litigation. Reason-giving requirements hold&nbsp;the promise of increasing the saliency and reducing the complexity of certain&nbsp;regulatory issues. But the availability and scope of discovery is limited. When a&nbsp;public-interest group brings a record-review litigation, or attempts to compel the&nbsp;regulator to act, very little new information comes out. Another problem with&nbsp;administrative litigation is that it is often less attractive for journalists to cover.&nbsp;Not newsworthy enough, in their eyes. We saw in </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 2</span><span class="font21"> that part of the&nbsp;reason that journalists troll court documents is that they can often find there the&nbsp;materials for a good story, in particular identifiable victims and villains. Record-review litigation, by comparison, is dull. As a result, the reputational effects&nbsp;frequently come not necessarily from administrative litigation, but from other&nbsp;channels. One such channel is the aforementioned torts against the government.&nbsp;Another is litigation between two private parties that indirectly implicates the&nbsp;regulator’s behavior.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark78"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark841"></a>6.4 How Private Litigation Impacts&nbsp;Regulators' Reputation</span></h4>
<p><span class="font21">It is intuitive to think that judicial review of regulatory behavior would affect what we think about the regulator. Less intuitively, but sometimes more&nbsp;importantly, even litigation between two private parties can affect regulators’&nbsp;reputation. </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Section 6.4.1</span><span class="font21"> sheds light on common scenarios in private litigation&nbsp;where the regulator’s behavior is implicated. </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Section 6.4.2</span><span class="font21"> distinguishes between&nbsp;our reputation-through-litigation argument and the extant regulation-through-litigation literature.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark842"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark843"></a>6.4.1 The Basic Story</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">Litigation can make us reevaluate what we think about a regulator, even when the regulator is not a side to it. Think about a scenario of mass tort litigation&nbsp;between a polluting plant and victims who live in proximity to the plant. Such&nbsp;litigation may reveal information on how the defendant company skirted&nbsp;environmental regulation and got away with it. The litigation may thus affect not&nbsp;just the defendant company’s reputation, but also the regulator’s reputation,&nbsp;raising questions about how the regulator let the pollution happen under her not-so-watchful eye.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">To use a concreate example, consider the 2008 Pulitzer-winning project on faulty regulation of baby products.— There, the investigative journalists drew&nbsp;heavily from documents produced in litigation between victims of product&nbsp;defects and manufacturers of said products. Yet the journalists did not make it a&nbsp;story about a specific defected car seat or harmed baby. They rather pieced&nbsp;together the evidence into a big-picture story about systematic failures in&nbsp;regulating baby products, pointing fingers at the “captive,” “myopic,” and&nbsp;“docile” Consumer Product Safety Commission (CSPC). The private lawsuits&nbsp;therefore helped implicating the CSPC’s reputation, without the CSPC being a&nbsp;side in litigation. Following the journalistic exposé and ensuing public backlash,&nbsp;the CSPC changed its ways and acted more aggressively, as in making more&nbsp;sweeping recall demands. The reputational pressure seemingly worked. Another&nbsp;example comes from the tobacco litigation. There, the judge’s 1,742-page&nbsp;verdict was a “ringing denunciation” of the defendant tobacco companies.<sup>61&nbsp;</sup>More pertinently, however, is that press coverage of the verdict did not stop at&nbsp;criticizing the tobacco companies, but pointed fingers at the regulators, for not&nbsp;having enough gumption to rein in the powerful industry.<sup>62</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The mechanisms through which private litigation typically affects regulators’ reputation differ from the ones we highlighted in the previous&nbsp;section, when discussing judicial review. Unlike judicial review, judges&nbsp;presiding over private litigation would not require the regulator to provide&nbsp;detailed reasoning, or directly evaluate the adequacy of regulators’ reasoning.&nbsp;Yet in private litigation the parties themselves have strong incentives to use their&nbsp;fact-finding powers to extract information that indirectly implicates regulators’&nbsp;behavior.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">To illustrate, consider the frequent usage of two tort law doctrines, namely, </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">regulatory compliance defense</span><span class="font21"> and </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">negligence per se.</span><span class="font21"> Defendants are the ones&nbsp;raising the regulatory compliance defense, arguing that their behavior cannot be&nbsp;negligent if they complied with existing statutory/regulatory standards; or that&nbsp;their product cannot be defective if it meets the relevant regulatory&nbsp;requirements.— Yet the law treats regulatory compliance only as a partial&nbsp;defense. It is therefore not enough for defendants to show evidence of their&nbsp;compliance with the standard; they also have to convince the court that the&nbsp;standard is worthy. In other words, the regulatory compliance defense “rests on a&nbsp;factual presumption regarding the regulatory process.”<sup>64</sup> In deciding whether to&nbsp;accept the defense, courts would typically evaluate the regulatory process: how&nbsp;deliberative, fair, thorough, and sound it was; whether the regulators have been&nbsp;updating the standard to keep with evolving knowledge of the risk in question;&nbsp;and so on.<sup>65</sup> It is not hard to envision such private litigation turning into a&nbsp;referendum on how competent and public serving the regulator has been.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">There is a broader point at play here, about the complementarities between regulation and litigation. Many commentators have called on courts to adopt a&nbsp;stronger version of the regulatory compliance defense.<sup>66</sup> These commentators&nbsp;usually invoke an institutional competence argument: regulators develop&nbsp;expertise, and so generalist courts should defer to them more.<sup>67</sup> Yet the&nbsp;proponents of stronger regulatory compliance defense miss a crucial aspect,&nbsp;namely, information problems. Regulators often rely on information from the&nbsp;regulated industry itself when setting standards </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">ex ante.<sup>68</sup></span><span class="font21"> As a result, regulators&nbsp;may set the standards suboptimally to begin with, and fail to update it over time&nbsp;when a more stringent standard is called for. Remember the regulating rates of&nbsp;return example: the regulator depends on the industry to trigger an update, yet&nbsp;the industry has no incentives to trigger an update that makes things worse for&nbsp;them. Litigation serves a key function here: extracting valuable information on&nbsp;whether the standard is adequate or needs updating. Once the information&nbsp;surfaces, regulators may be compelled to protect their reputation by updating the&nbsp;standard. And the mere background threat of litigation deters regulators </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">ex ante.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">While the regulatory compliance defense often implicates the regulator’s </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">standard-setting</span><span class="font21"> prowess, the negligence per se doctrine typically implicates the&nbsp;regulator’s </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">enforcement</span><span class="font21"> efforts. Plaintiffs are the ones raising the negligence per&nbsp;se claim: if you manage to show that defendants routinely skirted regulation, you&nbsp;can establish negligence.<sup>69</sup> The prospect of securing</span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">punitive damages</span><span class="font21"> especially&nbsp;incentivizes plaintiffs to not limit themselves to bringing evidence about the&nbsp;particular harm done to them, but rather produce evidence on defendant&nbsp;misconduct more broadly, such as showing how defendants have been&nbsp;suppressing information on adverse health effects.<sup>70</sup> When the media follows up&nbsp;on such evidence, they often do not limit themselves to the “big bad polluting&nbsp;company” framing, but also adopt a “regulators were asleep at the helm!” angle,&nbsp;suggesting to their readers that a lax regulatory enforcement let the industry off&nbsp;the hook.—</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark844"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark845"></a>6.4.2 Refining the Basic Story: Information Production vs. Reputation-Shaping</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">I am hardly the first one that argues that private litigation can lead to changes in regulation. A sizable literature - grouped together for our purposes under the&nbsp;“regulation through litigation” moniker - looks at how litigation is not only&nbsp;about settling past disputes, but also about bringing sweeping changes to&nbsp;defendants’ future behavior.<sup>72</sup> The main difference between my argument and&nbsp;that literature lies in the mechanism of influence. Each account answers the&nbsp;</span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">“how</span><span class="font21"> litigation brings about societal change” question differently. The extant&nbsp;accounts suggest that policy changes come from judicial rulings, directly: judges&nbsp;are acting as de facto legislators/regulators, filling gaps in statutory frameworks,&nbsp;and forcing defendant companies to accept new regulations outside the normal&nbsp;political process.<sup>73</sup> I, by contrast, suggest that the process of litigation propels&nbsp;the regulators to act on their own, because it threatens their reputations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">If private litigation indeed influences regulation only </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">indirectly,</span><span class="font21"> it takes the sting away from the most common criticism of regulatory litigation, namely, the&nbsp;criticism of unaccountability. Many scholars have used the “regulation through&nbsp;litigation” moniker in a negative connotation, claiming that unaccountable&nbsp;judges and plaintiffs’ lawyers make broad societal changes without input from&nbsp;the public.<sup>74</sup> Yet if the main effect of litigation is reputational, then input from&nbsp;the public plays a key role. When litigation generates information and raises&nbsp;public awareness to regulatory behavior, it arguably </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">increases</span><span class="font21"> public&nbsp;accountability and facilitates meaningful participation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">In that regard, my account of private litigation is closest to Wendy Wagner’s version, which emphasizes the information-extracting qualities of&nbsp;litigation.<sup>75</sup> Litigation helps regulators regulate better, Wagner claims, by&nbsp;providing them information. Litigation unlocks “stubborn information”:&nbsp;information that regulators have a hard time extracting from the regulated&nbsp;industry on their own.<sup>76</sup> Normally, the regulated industry can use their superior&nbsp;access to information and expertise, as well as other influence tactics, to keep&nbsp;crucial information away from regulators. Litigation disrupts these dynamics:&nbsp;when regulated companies face resourceful plaintiff lawyers armed with court&nbsp;junctions, they reluctantly provide the needed information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Where my argument differs from Wagner’s is in the difference between producing information and affecting reputations. In my version, litigation&nbsp;propels regulators to act not solely by surfacing information, but also by&nbsp;facilitating wide </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">diffusion</span><span class="font21"> (typically through media coverage) and proper&nbsp;</span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">attribution</span><span class="font21"> (making sure the regulator’s overseers understand the regulator’s role&nbsp;in the debacle) of that information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The BRT literature teaches us that to it is not so much the availability, but rather the visibility of information that propels regulators to act.<sup>77</sup> Producing&nbsp;new information is therefore neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for&nbsp;litigation to bring about regulatory changes.<sup>78</sup> A deeper look at many&nbsp;paradigmatic examples of regulatory litigation reveals that the regulators already&nbsp;enjoyed access to the information in question, or could have easily accessed it.<sup>79&nbsp;</sup>To borrow Wagner’s term, the information in question in these cases was hardly&nbsp;“stubborn.” The real impact of litigation came not from producing new&nbsp;information but rather from lighting a fire underneath the regulators’ feet. I&nbsp;observed similar dynamics in my study of the 1995-2015 Pulitzer-winning&nbsp;investigations: more often than not, the problem was not that regulators could&nbsp;not access information, but rather that regulators were too reluctant to act against&nbsp;powerful players (and then started acting once the issue gained saliency).</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">In the clergy-sexual abuse scandal, for example, litigation made it “politically less costly” to take action against the powerful Catholic Church.—&nbsp;Along similar lines, Ida Tarbell’s muckraking project on the Standard Oil&nbsp;Company relied on information from law enforcement actions that was already&nbsp;available to the public, and certainly to regulators. Yet it was only after Tarbell&nbsp;published her stories that the attorney general mustered courage to break the&nbsp;monopoly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Litigation brings about regulatory change when it manages to make the costs of regulatory failures obtrusive to the regulators’ overseers in the public&nbsp;and congress. It pushes an issue to the top of the media, public, and regulatory&nbsp;agendas.<sup>81</sup> In communication scientists’ lingo, this is the difference between&nbsp;“framing” and “priming.”— Existing accounts of regulation through litigation&nbsp;focus on </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">framing</span><span class="font21"> effects, suggesting that litigation shapes how a certain situation&nbsp;(e.g., the dangers of smoking) is presented to the public. I, by contrast, focus on&nbsp;</span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">priming</span><span class="font21"> effects, suggesting that litigation directs the public’s attention to certain&nbsp;attributes of the regulator, making us evaluate the regulator on the basis of these&nbsp;traits (e.g., not being diligent enough in demanding information from the tobacco&nbsp;industry).</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark80"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark846"></a>6.5 Implications</span></h4>
<p><span class="font21">Recognizing that judicial review affects regulators not just directly, by striking down their decisions, but also indirectly, by producing information that shapes&nbsp;their reputations, opens up space to reassessing the extant literature on judicial&nbsp;review and its policy implications. If litigation indeed generates information and&nbsp;affects the reputation of regulators, then the main thrust of the implications we&nbsp;have sketched in previous chapters, for doctrines of corporate and securities&nbsp;laws, apply also here, for doctrines of administrative and constitutional law. This&nbsp;section applies the reputational perspective to reevaluate longstanding debates&nbsp;over the hard look doctrine, standing limitations, confidential settlements, and&nbsp;judicial activism.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark847"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark848"></a>6.5.1 Standards of Review</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">The extent literature on judicial review endlessly debates whether courts should interfere with regulators’ decisions. One camp argues that judges interfere too&nbsp;much. Nonelected, generalist judges should not interfere with the decisions of&nbsp;elected and professional regulators, or so the argument goes.</span><span class="font16">83 </span><span class="font21">Yet, if judicial&nbsp;review can make public officials change their behavior not necessarily by&nbsp;striking down their decisions, but rather by making them face public pressure,&nbsp;then judicial review arguably makes the political system </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">more</span><span class="font21"> representative of&nbsp;citizens’ preferences.<sup>84</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The other camp argues that judges defer too much. Courts employ abstention doctrines and rarely intervene in regulatory decisions. Further, in the&nbsp;rare events where courts do not abstain, they limit their review to the process,&nbsp;rather than the merits, of the decision in question.<sup>85</sup> Yet from an information-production perspective, it matters less if courts ultimately decide to defer to the&nbsp;regulator’s judgment, as long as the</span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">process</span><span class="font21"> of litigation flushes out information&nbsp;about how the regulators behaved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Abstention doctrines and lax standards of review would hurt information production only to the extent that they serve as pleading hurdles of sorts, killing&nbsp;any challenge in its infancy (or discouraging public-interest groups from filing in&nbsp;court </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">ex ante).</span><span class="font21"> If, on the other hand, Justice Scalia was right in saying that&nbsp;deference does not mean “anything more than considering [the views of the&nbsp;other branches] with attentiveness and profound respect” before the court rejects&nbsp;them, then there is little reason to worry about information production.<sup>86</sup> In other&nbsp;words, we should not evaluate the effectiveness of judicial review merely&nbsp;through the legal bottom line. Much like with in discussion of corporate law&nbsp;litigation and the deferential business judgment rule, the legal outcomes of&nbsp;administrative litigation may skew toward respondents, yet the process itself can&nbsp;shed light on how problematic respondents’ behavior has been, thereby&nbsp;propelling them to change their behavior </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">ex ante.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">To illustrate, consider the extensive debate over the hard look doctrine.— Several scholars have suggested that the hard look doctrine must be&nbsp;inconsequential, not guiding actual judicial review, because the empirical&nbsp;evidence shows that agencies enjoy a very high win rate in courts.— Scholars&nbsp;also point out that regardless of the standard that courts apply (e.g., </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Chevron<sup>90&nbsp;</sup></span><span class="font21">vs. </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Skidmore),—</span><span class="font21"> agencies’ win rates remain roughly the same.<sup>92</sup> Yet to fully&nbsp;evaluate the hard look doctrine, we cannot limit ourselves to the “legal” results&nbsp;of cases (i.e., how courts decide, as illustrated by agencies’ win rates). We also&nbsp;need to take into account the ultimate results, that is, how regulators changed&nbsp;their behavior following litigation. The hard look doctrine affects the quantity&nbsp;and quality of information production during litigation. A regulator that needs to&nbsp;explain herself to the court under the hard look doctrine will have to produce&nbsp;granular information on what, why, and how she decided. And courts are more&nbsp;likely, under the hard look doctrine, to provide a detailed, relatively accessible&nbsp;account on how the regulator behaved. In other words, to evaluate the hard look&nbsp;doctrine we cannot satisfy ourselves with evidence about who wins in court; we&nbsp;rather need to look at how media coverage of the regulatory issue changed&nbsp;during and after litigation, and how the regulator reacted. The doctrine may not&nbsp;matter much for the legal results, but it matters for the reputational results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">A concrete example comes from our </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 4</span><span class="font21"> story of judicial review of the SEC. After Judge Rakoff started raising questions vocally, the SEC&nbsp;settlement practices had become the center of national attention. The SEC had&nbsp;eventually won the legal battle, as the Second Circuit Court of Appeals has&nbsp;reemphasized the need to defer to the regulators’ discretion. Yet by then the SEC&nbsp;had already lost the battle in the court of public opinion, and had to react by&nbsp;publicly changing their enforcement policies to require more admissions going&nbsp;forward.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark849"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark850"></a>6.5.2 Standing and Redressability</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">If courts indeed affect the reputational pressures that operate on regulators, then access to courts dictates the vector of such reputational pressures. To fulfill its&nbsp;potential and combat the asymmetries in monitoring abilities, access to court&nbsp;itself has to be symmetric - available to public-interest groups as it is to special-interest groups. Yet in reality, even after the 1970s wave of liberalizing standing&nbsp;requirements,— there remain great asymmetries: the regulated industry&nbsp;establishes standing much easier than the supposed beneficiaries of regulation&nbsp;(the public, via public-interest groups) do. First, there is the “injury-in-fact”&nbsp;requirement: courts normally do not allow standings in issues of wide grievance,&nbsp;insisting that the plaintiff shows that she was specifically injured.— Then, there&nbsp;is the “redressability” requirement: plaintiffs have to show that the remedies they&nbsp;seek are capable of redressing the supposed harms.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The one-two punch of injury in fact and redressability has significantly limited the ability of public-interest groups to challenge in courts - and thereby&nbsp;draw attention to - certain types of regulatory misbehavior.— While I am hardly&nbsp;the first to point out the asymmetries in standing between special-interest- and&nbsp;public-interest groups,<sup>97</sup> the reputational angle does add a new twist to the&nbsp;debate: spotlighting an underappreciated benefit of symmetric access to courts.&nbsp;Access to courts leads to access to the media agenda. And access to media&nbsp;agenda leads to influence on regulatory agenda.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">This is more than just a semantic exercise. Recognizing the links between judicial review to media agenda, and between media agenda to regulatory&nbsp;behavior, has implications for how courts should apply the redressability&nbsp;requirement. When evaluating redressability, courts inevitably engage in some&nbsp;kind of forecasting: deciphering whether the remedies sought can redress the&nbsp;harm. Recognizing that judicial review generates reputational pressures should&nbsp;affect the forecasting. Even in cases where judicial review is not likely to&nbsp;provide compensation to a specific past injury, it may nevertheless generate&nbsp;reputational pressures that will deter future harms. Pertinently, court-induced&nbsp;reputational pressures are likely to reduce the probabilities of future harms to the&nbsp;group that the plaintiffs represent.—</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark851"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark852"></a>6.5.3 Confidential Settlements</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">We saw that an important channel of reputation-relevant information on regulators are torts against the government. This type of litigation escapes many&nbsp;of the limitations of administrative litigation: it features more extensive&nbsp;discovery and is relatively immune to politicization of judges; it comes with&nbsp;strong monetary incentives for plaintiffs and their lawyers to extract damning&nbsp;information; and so on. Yet torts against the government have one problematic&nbsp;feature, namely, the tendency of parties to the dispute to agree to keep the&nbsp;information exchanged during litigation confidential, in exchange for&nbsp;higher/earlier settlements. </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 7</span><span class="font21"> will elaborate on the divergence between&nbsp;private and public incentives: both parties have incentives to agree to&nbsp;confidentiality, while the public interest would benefit from openness. The same&nbsp;dynamics may apply even more strongly in the context of torts against the&nbsp;government, due to the agency problem: taxpayers who are not privy to litigation&nbsp;are the ones paying for settlements, while the defendant regulators are the ones&nbsp;enjoying the benefits of confidentiality.— The upshot is that we should consider&nbsp;imposing limitations on the ability of regulators to settle, and to settle&nbsp;confidentially. Such limitations already exist in certain regulatory areas in the&nbsp;United States and elsewhere in the world,<sup>100</sup> and we should aim to expand that&nbsp;blueprint.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark853"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark854"></a>6.5.4 The Role of Judicial Review in Mitigating Regulatory Capture</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">The final implication is the most general one: applying the reputational perspective to reassess the debate over the proper role of judicial review in&nbsp;mitigating regulatory capture. Proponents of judicial review claim that it is an&nbsp;important check on regulatory capture.<sup>101</sup> By adding another veto point, judicial&nbsp;review increases the costs of capturing the system, or so the argument goes.<sup>102&nbsp;</sup>And it is an especially effective veto point, proponents claim: judges enjoy&nbsp;tenure and so are less amenable to capture by career concerns, and are, in&nbsp;general, more neutral and less politically involved.<sup>103</sup> Other scholars dismiss this&nbsp;optimistic account. They emphasize how only a subset of regulatory behaviors&nbsp;are reviewable, as courts tend to avoid second-guessing regulatory decisions.<sup>104</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">To judge which claim is more convincing, we need to make some assumptions about what drives regulators. If, as in traditional public choice&nbsp;theory, you believe that regulators mostly maximize their narrow self-interest,&nbsp;then you have to acknowledge that there is little that judicial review can do.&nbsp;Judges may invalidate specific captured regulatory decisions after the fact, but&nbsp;they cannot overcome the inherent advantages that special interests enjoy in the&nbsp;way of offering lucrative future business opportunities or campaign financing.&nbsp;Judicial review is limited in dealing with the basic incentive problems that public&nbsp;choice highlights, for various reasons. Special-interest groups employ their&nbsp;better resources to use the judicial review channel in their favor. The same veto&nbsp;point meant to fight off attempts to capture the system, is in reality often used to&nbsp;fight off and delay public-interest reforms.<sup>105</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">If, on the other hand, you think that regulators care about reputation and that judicial review may affect regulators’ reputation, then you are more likely to&nbsp;view judicial review as part of the solution to regulatory capture. We can couch&nbsp;the argument similarly to how we did in the corporate context: it is well accepted&nbsp;that media scrutiny, when done effectively, is a great antidote to regulatory&nbsp;capture.<sup>106</sup> Now the question becomes what determines the effectiveness of&nbsp;media scrutiny. If one recognizes that judicial review can increase the saliency&nbsp;and reduce the complexity of a given regulatory issue, then the evidence we&nbsp;discussed in </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 2</span><span class="font21"> suggests that such judicial review would greatly increase&nbsp;the effectiveness of media scrutiny of said issue. Once an issue gains saliency,&nbsp;and becomes more understandable and coverable by the media, the threat of&nbsp;public backlash reverses the special-interest group politics dynamics. Judicial&nbsp;review can therefore have a salutary effect on regulatory behavior in ways that&nbsp;were hitherto underappreciated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Viewing judicial review from such reputational perspective provides some clues as to when courts should be more or less active when reviewing regulators’&nbsp;decisions: the key is in saliency and complexity. Judicial review would be most&nbsp;desirable in cases where the costs and benefits of regulation are less salient to the&nbsp;public.<sup>107</sup></span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark82"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark855"></a>6.6 Final Thoughts: Public Litigation's&nbsp;Relative Impact on Reputation</span></h4>
<p><span class="font21">We saw throughout this chapter that the reputation-through-litigation argument works differently in public litigation than it does in private litigation. Part of the&nbsp;difference is due to legal doctrines, such as lack of far-reaching discovery in&nbsp;public litigation. Another part of the difference is due to the alternatives - the&nbsp;non-litigation sources of information in play. Litigation is not the only channel&nbsp;through which the legal system shapes regulators’ reputation. Nonjudicial&nbsp;channels, such as freedom of information (FOI) requests or congressional&nbsp;oversight hearings, also play a role.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">FOI is not available for private entities but is in play for public entities, facilitating bottom-up monitoring of regulators. The more the media and the&nbsp;public can rely on non-litigation information, the less the (relative) reputational&nbsp;impact of litigation would be. Indeed, this difference between public and private&nbsp;litigation came up in each method I used in my “law-as-source” study detailed in&nbsp;</span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 2</span><span class="font21">. The investigative reporters I interviewed frequently cited the ability&nbsp;to rely on FOI laws as one reason for why it is relatively easier to hold big&nbsp;government to account than to hold big business to account. The reporters’ tip&nbsp;sheets on how to scrutinize the government make less frequent references to&nbsp;court documents than tip sheets on how to scrutinize private businesses. And the&nbsp;content analysis of prizewinning investigative projects reveals a recurring theme:&nbsp;a journalist submitting a FOI request to extract information from regulators, and&nbsp;then using it to show her readers how the regulator has been sitting on the&nbsp;information without acting on it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">To illustrate, consider the 2015 Pulitzer-winning story on healthcare providers milking Medicare at the expense of taxpayers. </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Wall Street Journal&nbsp;</span><span class="font21">reporters submitted FOIA requests that forced to government to release&nbsp;Medicare data kept secret for decades. The reporters then sifted through the data&nbsp;and packaged it into a compelling story, showing for example how doctors are&nbsp;routinely testing the elderly for drugs such as heroin and “angel dust.” The&nbsp;reporters also made the costs of Medicare abuse clear, indicating that taxpayers&nbsp;are on the hook for nearly $60 billion on bogus payments each year.— The&nbsp;</span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">JournaPs</span><span class="font21"> story ignited a public outcry. And the public outcry propelled&nbsp;regulators to act: the relevant federal agency started denying industry’s requests&nbsp;to cover even more questionable tests, the FBI started investigating medical&nbsp;providers who collected alarmingly high amounts of Medicare money, and so&nbsp;on.<sup>109</sup> Note how this newfound regulatory action was due not to new information&nbsp;but rather to increased saliency: the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Journal'</span><span class="font21">s FOIA request simply surfaced&nbsp;(and highlighted, and widely diffused) data that was available to regulators but&nbsp;kept secret from the public since 1979.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Yet another channel that implicates regulators’ reputation is </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">nonjudicial reviews.</span><span class="font21"> Think for example about the regulation czar - the Office of Information&nbsp;and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) - reviewing the work of a specific regulator, or&nbsp;of a congressional oversight hearing where the regulator is “grilled.”— Here as&nbsp;well, the list of Pulitzer-winning investigations provides cases in point. In 2003,&nbsp;the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span><span class="font21"> exposed the abuse of the mentally ill in state-regulated&nbsp;homes. The </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Times&quot;</span><span class="font21"> reporter culled more than 5,000 pages of annual state&nbsp;inspection records, using them to draw attention to longstanding disorder in&nbsp;state-run homes.<sup>111</sup> The reporting prompted a class-action lawsuit, which later&nbsp;translated into New York State’s Department of Health gradually moving many&nbsp;of the mentally ill residents to better locations and treatment.— Again it was not&nbsp;new information but rather the journalistic spotlight that propelled action: the&nbsp;state itself had been issuing damning reports for decades, but chose to ignore&nbsp;them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Similar dynamics were in play a year earlier, with the 2002 Pulitzer-winning investigation of neglect of kids in foster homes. There, the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Washington Post</span><span class="font21"> obtained records of a Child Fatality Review Committee. The Committee&nbsp;consistently detailed the neglect and deaths of many kids put in protective care,&nbsp;yet its conclusions were heard only in closed-doors government meetings, and its&nbsp;recommendations were constantly buried.— Once the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Post</span><span class="font21"> journalists&nbsp;spotlighted and packaged the data into a compelling story, the regulator stepped&nbsp;in, overhauling the child welfare system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">On paper, then, FOIA and nonjudicial reviews should provide ample information for journalists to hold regulators to account. Yet as </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 2&nbsp;</span><span class="font21">alluded to, these channels are too often lacking. The implementation of FOIA is&nbsp;dysfunctional, fraught with delays and denials. And congress convenes special&nbsp;hearings usually only on issues that already gained saliency. Congressional&nbsp;hearings normally do not spotlight an ignored issue - they amplify an issue that&nbsp;has already reached the spotlight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The upshot is that while non-litigation channels play a more prominent role in holding regulators to account (relative to holding businesses to account), they&nbsp;still cannot fully substitute litigation-generated reputational pressures. In the&nbsp;regulatory arena, much like in the business arena, litigation is needed to&nbsp;supplement the information environment and facilitate reputational control.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">A promising venue for future research would be identifying the regulatory areas in which litigation plays a bigger/smaller role in inducing reputational&nbsp;pressures. In some areas, the market for regulators’ reputation works fine even&nbsp;without litigation. Think for example of regulatory areas where the feedback is&nbsp;immediate and clear, as in when under-regulation brings about catastrophes that&nbsp;cause acute identifiable harms to victims. In other regulatory areas, reputational&nbsp;concerns would not work without litigation. Think about areas where the harms&nbsp;are more latent, opaque, and disperse, as in toxic pollution that increases the&nbsp;probability of future latent diseases. In these areas, the implications we noted&nbsp;earlier (such as the case against confidential settlements, or for liberal standing)&nbsp;apply more forcefully.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">A N D P H A R M A C E U T I C A L R E G U L AT I O N AT T H E F D A </span><span class="font21">45 (2010). There are at least two related-yet-distinct notions of regulators’ reputation. One is the notion of&nbsp;regulators’ career concerns, which is oft-mentioned in the context of the&nbsp;“revolving doors” argument: regulators wish to maximize their future earning&nbsp;opportunities, and this desire affects their behavior while in the public sector.&nbsp;Such labor-market reputation notion is different from the one we use here,&nbsp;which speaks to how regulators seek the positive evaluations and esteem of&nbsp;various audiences, such as those who appoint them or are affected by them,&nbsp;beyond and regardless of future job opportunities. Another important&nbsp;distinction concerns the different effects of reputation at the level of the&nbsp;individual, and reputation at the level of the regulatory agency. We collapse&nbsp;this distinction for our purposes here, for considerations of scope. Brevity and&nbsp;scope also dictate that we lump together all types of regulators - political&nbsp;appointees, “lifer” bureaucrats, and so forth. In reality, reputational concerns&nbsp;operate differently on each type of regulator. But for our modest purposes&nbsp;here, namely, drawing attention to a hitherto-understudied channel of&nbsp;influence on regulators (information coming from the legal system), treating&nbsp;them as a group suffices.</span></p>

William Eskridge, for example,&nbsp;suggests a set of cases in which judges engaging in statutory interpretation&nbsp;should give little weight to legislative history/intent and be less inclined to&nbsp;defer: regulatory issues that involve a “concentrated-benefits; dispersed-costs”&nbsp;structure. In such a framework, judicial review should apply more forcefully&nbsp;in areas where asymmetries in information and coordination abilities are the&nbsp;strongest. William N.

<p><span class="font21">In our framework, by contrast, judicial review should focus on areas where the asymmetries in </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">monitoring</span><span class="font21"> abilities are the strongest. To be sure, there is a&nbsp;sizable overlap: many regulations that confer benefits on a powerful,&nbsp;concentrated group at the expense of the public are ones with low visibility&nbsp;and high complexity. Still, there exist ample examples of mismatches, such as&nbsp;when a regulatory issue imposes costs on the dispersed public, yet enjoys high&nbsp;visibility. In these types of cases, judicial activism is needed less: the public&nbsp;awareness may be enough to hold regulators to account and mitigate the risk&nbsp;of capture.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Implications</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The Case for Openness</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark86"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark968"></a>7.1 Introduction</span></h4>
<p><span class="font21">Throughout this book we have looked at examples from prizewinning journalistic stories that were told with the help of legal sources. But we have not&nbsp;looked at stories that were </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font21"> told. What about stories that were not told&nbsp;because the legal system held information back, stonewalling journalists? We&nbsp;usually get a peek at such counterfactuals in cases where the information&nbsp;eventually gets out, after being buried for a while.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Such was the case with the cover-up of child abuse in the Catholic Church. Elsewhere I used the clergy sexual-abuse litigation as an example of a success&nbsp;story in which the interactions between the media and the courts helped hold the&nbsp;powerful to account.<sup>1</sup> Law created reputational pressures that pushed the&nbsp;powerful organization to admit mistakes and change its ways. Yet one could also&nbsp;view the example as illustrating a failure to warn.</span><span class="font16">2 </span><span class="font21">The legal system had&nbsp;produced the damning information on the cover-up of child abuse many years&nbsp;before it became available to journalists. Only after a fortuitous turn of events -and a media outlet financially strong enough to fight a lengthy legal battle to&nbsp;unseal documents - did the information turn into a journalistic source. Had the&nbsp;information become available earlier, one could argue, many cases of child&nbsp;abuse could have been avoided. The reputational sanction came too late.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">That was a recurring theme in my interviews with reporters. Right after they told me how instrumental legal sources are for them, reporters would&nbsp;usually continue to voice frustration with a legal system that produces&nbsp;information yet keeps it away from them, sealing documents and redacting&nbsp;details. This frustration touches upon a long-standing debate in the legal&nbsp;literature over how publicly available law enforcement records should be.</span><span class="font16">3 </span><span class="font21">The&nbsp;debate spans multiple applications: settlement versus trial, openness of&nbsp;proceedings, and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">This chapter applies the law-as-source framework to contribute to the openness-versus-secrecy debate along three key dimensions. </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Section 7.2</span><span class="font21"> injects&nbsp;a real-life implications perspective into a too-often abstracted debate. </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Section 7.3&nbsp;</span><span class="font21">disentangles the normally comingled facets of the openness-versus-secrecy&nbsp;debate.<sup>4</sup> Law-as-source dynamics play out differently in questions such as&nbsp;whether to keep the amount of a settlement secret or whether to seal documents&nbsp;already submitted to the court. </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Section 7.4</span><span class="font21"> provides a road map for concrete&nbsp;steps that can facilitate more law-as-source benefits. </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Section 7.5</span><span class="font21"> concludes on a&nbsp;different, big-picture note, calling for more cautious approach when advocating&nbsp;for nonintervention.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark88"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark969"></a>7.2 Real-Life Implications of Secrecy</span></h4>
<p><span class="font21">The argument for and against secrecy follows a similar formula across a wide array of applications. Those in favor of openness usually summon considerations&nbsp;of increased accountability and accuracy of judicial decision-making.</span><span class="font16">5 </span><span class="font21">Those in&nbsp;favor of confidentiality cite the need to respect the parties’ autonomy and to&nbsp;conserve public and private resources.<sup>6</sup> What both camps agree on, however, is&nbsp;the need to inject some evidence into the debate.<sup>7</sup> Specifically, both camps agree&nbsp;that we do not know much about how openness-versus-secrecy affects third&nbsp;parties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Take, for concreteness, the debate over secret settlements.<sup>8</sup> Those against secret settlements argue that keeping the details about underlying misbehavior&nbsp;secret endangers public safety, as it fails to warn third parties.<sup>9</sup> Those favoring&nbsp;secret settlements retort that the public-safety argument rests on shaky&nbsp;grounds.<sup>10</sup> Most of the time, they claim, settlements contain information already&nbsp;available to regulators or to anyone who reads the initial complaint. If the public&nbsp;really wants to avoid a certain defendant, they can do so even without reading&nbsp;the settlement. Further, the public would not know what to do with information&nbsp;coming from open settlements. Settlement is not adjudication, and the public&nbsp;“cannot reliably evaluate what settlement information means.”—</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The evidence presented in </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 2</span><span class="font21"> helps us remove some of the skepticism over the ability of open settlements to warn the public. The clergy&nbsp;sexual-abuse litigation illustrates. The </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Boston Globe</span><span class="font21"> had documented proof of&nbsp;the church’s cover-up only because one plaintiffs lawyer (you might recall him&nbsp;from the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Spotlight</span><span class="font21"> movie as the eccentric Mitchell Garabedian) insisted on&nbsp;fighting the church, one trial at a time, without signing secret settlements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 2</span><span class="font21"> establishes a prima facie case to consider seriously the ability of the media to turn open settlements into watchdog journalism with teeth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Relatedly, the law-as-source study illustrates what is wrong with the argument that the public would not know what to do with open settlements. In&nbsp;reality, the public does not sift through court records and settlement agreements.&nbsp;Information intermediaries do: stock analysts, institutional investors, consumer&nbsp;organizations, and, notably, investigative reporters. Investigative reporters test&nbsp;the reliability of raw data they get from court documents, and triangulate it with&nbsp;other sources. They use details from scattered settlements to identify and&nbsp;describe a pervasive pattern of institutional misconduct. Unlike beat reporters or&nbsp;news reporters, investigative reporters are less interested in the color and more&nbsp;interested in the pattern. That is, they do not read a single settlement in isolation,&nbsp;but rather view it as a lead that can help them find patterns of recurring&nbsp;misconduct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The upshot for our purposes is that information intermediaries will make it easier for the public to make sense of the limited information contained in a&nbsp;settlement and to react accordingly.<sup>12</sup> Confidentiality provisions that hide even&nbsp;the basic details of the dispute hurt the ability of the media to effectively inform&nbsp;the public.<sup>13</sup></span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark90"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark970"></a>7.3 Disentangling the Issues</span></h4>
<p><span class="font21">The evidence on how journalists use information from the legal system to promote accountability allows us to unpack the different confidentiality&nbsp;doctrines that the literature has traditionally failed to distinguish.— There exist&nbsp;important differences, for example, between the desirability of keeping the&nbsp;amount of a settlement confidential and protecting all discovery-exchanged&nbsp;documents. This section applies the law-as-source angle to reassess and&nbsp;distinguish between documents filed with the court, such as expert opinions and&nbsp;documents exchanged among litigants but not filed with the court, such as&nbsp;discovery. The section then flags up a separate category, of one-sided arbitration&nbsp;clauses with class action waivers (which has become so crucial and timely that it&nbsp;gets its own chapter later), and resituates our earlier discussion of pleading&nbsp;standards.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark971"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark972"></a>7.3.1 Judicial Information</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">The category of “judicial information” encompasses information that has a direct connection to the process of judicial decision-making: trial transcripts, docket&nbsp;sheets, settlement agreements that are filed with the court, the right to attend&nbsp;trial, and so on.<sup>15</sup> On paper, this type of information can make a great source for&nbsp;investigative reporting, as the law presumes full public access to such&nbsp;documents.<sup>16</sup> Yet in reality, parties often stipulate to keep major aspects of&nbsp;judicial information private and judges are quick to approve.<sup>17</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The problem is that both parties have incentives to handle their disputes in ways that limit public access to judicial information.<sup>18</sup> Take the issue of secret&nbsp;settlements. While the fact that most cases settle has become a truism,<sup>19</sup> more&nbsp;relevant for our purposes is the fact that most cases settle secretly: the parties&nbsp;often stipulate to keep details of the dispute private.<sup>20</sup> Defendants are willing to&nbsp;pay more for a confidentiality provision, to save themselves the risk of adverse&nbsp;publicity. Plaintiffs anticipate defendants’ willingness to pay for secrecy, and use&nbsp;it as a bargaining chip. A plaintiff who receives a generous offer may not care&nbsp;about the positive externality; that is, she may not care whether relevant&nbsp;information gets out to third parties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Judges have discretion and can ignore the parties’ will and keep judicial information open. Yet judges too face skewed incentives: they are measured by&nbsp;caseload management, and not by the amorphous (and hitherto understudied)&nbsp;concept of how they contribute to information production.<sup>21</sup> The framework&nbsp;developed here would urge judges to overcome pressures to clear the docket and&nbsp;consider, among other factors, the law-as-source benefits emanating from&nbsp;openness. To be sure, not all cases implicate law-as-source considerations. As&nbsp;</span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 2</span><span class="font21"> noted, the nominal majority of legal disputes do not interest third&nbsp;parties. Yet in disputes involving large manufacturers or employers, whose&nbsp;behavior affects many, information production should factor in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">When factoring in information production, judges should be wary of the context. Not all disputes are created equal from an information-production&nbsp;perspective, and certain types of information are more likely to facilitate&nbsp;accountability journalism than others. In the secret settlements context, for&nbsp;instance, the problem is less about settlements that keep the amount paid secret,&nbsp;and more about settlements that erase all evidence of the dispute (including the&nbsp;parties’ names), or contain provisions requiring the destruction of information&nbsp;obtained during the dispute.<sup>22</sup> The amount agreed upon may be of interest to&nbsp;other potential legal claimants, or to a journalist on the beat looking for color,&nbsp;but it is less helpful to an investigative reporter looking for a pattern of recurring&nbsp;misbehavior or trying to understand what and how things happened. To establish&nbsp;a pattern and dig deeper into the behavior in question the media will need the&nbsp;basic details - the fact of the dispute and the names of the parties - to remain&nbsp;open to the public.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark973"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark974"></a>7.3.2 Litigant-Centered Information</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">A second major category of openness-versus-secrecy debates concerns litigant-centered information, such as pre-trial discovery documents, or settlement agreements that are not filed with the court. The law regarding such information&nbsp;is different: the strong presumption of openness that applies to judicial&nbsp;information does not apply here.<sup>23</sup> The rationale behind the different legal&nbsp;treatment is the link to judicial accountability: since documents not filed with the&nbsp;court are not part of judicial decision-making, there is less of a need to keep&nbsp;them open to allow monitoring of judicial decision-making, or so the argument&nbsp;goes.<sup>24</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Yet from a pure reputational perspective, discovery materials can be just as valuable as judicial information in facilitating media-driven accountability. In&nbsp;today’s world, trials are vanishing,— and the overwhelming majority of&nbsp;information being produced during legal disputes is not filed with the court. To&nbsp;ban openness of litigant-exchanged information is therefore to undermine the&nbsp;ability of the media to hold the powerful to account.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">From an investigative reporter’s perspective, the main role of discovery materials is less about understanding what happened (you can tell that from the&nbsp;complaint) and more about understanding </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">how</span><span class="font21"> things happened. Think about our&nbsp;oft-used example of internal company emails indicating what top management&nbsp;knew, when they knew it, and what they did or did not do to stop the&nbsp;misbehavior in question. Here, too, the Spotlight story is a case in point. The&nbsp;</span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Boston Globos</span><span class="font21"> investigative team sat on a child abuse story for many months,&nbsp;because they were searching for the bigger story on the cover-up of child abuse&nbsp;by higher-ups in the church. The reporters got their proof - and made an impact&nbsp;- only after getting access to internai church documents produced during&nbsp;discovery, showing who knew what and when.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark975"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark976"></a>7.3.3 Mandatory Arbitration Clauses</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">Nowhere is the openness-versus-secrecy debate more consequential and timelier than in our third category, of one-sided arbitration clauses. Two Supreme Court&nbsp;decisions in 2011 and 2013 - </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">AT&amp;T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion—</span><span class="font21"> and&nbsp;</span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">American Express Co. v. Italian Colors Restaurant—</span><span class="font21"> - expanded the scope of&nbsp;arbitration by enforcing unavoidable arbitration clauses that ban collective&nbsp;action.— The use of such arbitration clauses is constantly on the rise. As of 2017,&nbsp;80 percent of the 100 largest companies use mandatory arbitration clauses in&nbsp;employment contracts,— and over sixty million Americans have signed such&nbsp;arbitration clauses.<sup>30</sup> Such arbitration clauses represent the biggest threat to law-as-source benefits. When a judge seals documents or issues protective orders, the&nbsp;given legal dispute may nevertheless serve as a valuable source for investigative&nbsp;reporting, because journalists are able to cull the docket sheets, motions, and&nbsp;complaints.<sup>31</sup> By contrast, when disputes are increasingly “diffused”— -funneled to private arbitration or not pursued to begin with (because collective&nbsp;action is banned) - journalists are much less able to dig into the misbehavior in&nbsp;question.<sup>33</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">To illustrate, consider the case of misconduct in foster homes for kids or nursing homes for the elderly. Investigative reports revealing such misconduct&nbsp;historically relied heavily on information from litigation. Take for example the&nbsp;2002 Pulitzer-winning investigative report detailing the neglect of children&nbsp;placed in foster homes in the District of Columbia. </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 6</span><span class="font21"> relayed the story of&nbsp;how following the journalistic report, the city overhauled its child welfare&nbsp;program.<sup>34</sup> It is unclear whether such an investigative report could be written in&nbsp;today’s environment. Had the same type of misconduct occurred in the 2010s, it&nbsp;would probably have never reached the courts. A </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span><span class="font21"> exposé found&nbsp;that over 100 cases of wrongful death and other misconduct at nursing homes&nbsp;were pushed to private arbitration between 2010 and 2014.</span><span class="font16">35 </span><span class="font21">When the federal&nbsp;regulator in charge of Medicare and Medicaid funding proposed a rule barring&nbsp;nursing homes from funneling all residents’ claims to arbitration, the Trump&nbsp;administration stepped in and scrapped it— And because such disputes are not&nbsp;aired in the court anymore, information about the underlying misbehavior is&nbsp;more likely to remain out of the media’s reach</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Those in favor of the ever-proliferating arbitration clauses refer to the cost-saving attributes of arbitration relative to litigation. As one spokesperson puts it, “Arbitration provides a way for people to hold companies accountable without&nbsp;spending a lot of money.”<sup>37</sup> Even if we assume that such an assertion is&nbsp;empirically valid - that is, that individual consumers who are harmed get their&nbsp;money back effectively in arbitration<sup>38</sup> - the law-as-source perspective exposes&nbsp;two flaws in the spokesperson’s argument. First, when we evaluate the efficacy&nbsp;of dispute resolution channels, we should consider not just the costs and benefits&nbsp;to the parties to a specific dispute, but also the costs and benefits to society.&nbsp;Arbitration clauses with class waivers come with a set of societal costs in the&nbsp;form of reducing the effectiveness of media scrutiny. We will elaborate on this&nbsp;point in </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 8</span><span class="font21">, coming next.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Second, and relatedly, even if we assume that companies pay full damages in individual arbitrations, such payments hardly translate into public&nbsp;accountability. They are more like the small costs of doing business. When a&nbsp;cellular company overcharges its customers on a monthly basis, and then is&nbsp;dragged into an individual arbitration and pays back the full amount, this $30-sized sanction does not qualify as deterrence. To hold large companies truly&nbsp;accountable for their misbehavior, we should expose and diffuse information on&nbsp;their misbehavior. Reputational deterrence is a necessary tool for achieving&nbsp;corporate accountability. Yet reputational deterrence only works when&nbsp;information on corporate misconduct is publicly available.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">To be sure, applying the reputational perspective to argue against mandatory arbitration is less automatic than we have portrayed here thus far.&nbsp;This is why </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 8</span><span class="font21"> below delves into the issue in depth, with a special&nbsp;emphasis on mandatory arbitration of shareholder claims.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark977"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark978"></a>7.3.4 Pleading Standards</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">In </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 3</span><span class="font21"> we discussed the function of pleading standards in the specific context of corporate law litigation. But the pleading standard issue is much&nbsp;broader: following the Supreme Court decisions in </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Twombly</span><span class="font21"> and </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Iqbal,</span><span class="font21"> the&nbsp;heightened-versus-liberal-pleading-standards debate has become one of the most&nbsp;practical and heated in the legal world today.— The debate revolves around&nbsp;arguments such as conserving judicial resources, protecting defendants from&nbsp;frivolous lawsuits, and allowing access to justice.<sup>40</sup> This book suggests one more&nbsp;important factor to consider: heightened pleading standards affect information&nbsp;production negatively, thus indirectly hurting reputational deterrence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">To understand why, recall </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 2</span><span class="font21">'s discussion about how the earlier stages in the process often produce most of the reputation-relevant information.&nbsp;In large-scale disputes - where the misconduct is already revealed prior to&nbsp;litigation - the legal system’s comparative advantage (i.e., the chance that&nbsp;litigation will teach market players something they do not already know) comes&nbsp;from discovery. Heightened pleading standards reduce the chances that these&nbsp;cases will reach discovery, thus reducing the chances that new light will be shed&nbsp;on the misconduct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">A modification and clarification are in order. In most cases the reputational considerations are irrelevant (outside observers do not monitor them), and so my&nbsp;argument for liberal pleading standards does not apply. Nor do I suggest that&nbsp;screening frivolous lawsuits is unimportant. All I am suggesting is to include an&nbsp;overlooked factor in the cost-benefit analysis, namely, the benefit of producing&nbsp;information that helps market players assess companies (a positive externality).&nbsp;Concretely, a potential solution is to tailor different pleading standards based on&nbsp;the dispute’s impact on third parties. On paper, we can identify a subset of cases&nbsp;- say, well-publicized cases with large companies - where it is best to screen&nbsp;suits at a later stage (not at the motion to dismiss but rather at the summary&nbsp;judgment stage). We saw in </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 3</span><span class="font21"> that Delaware’s corporate law has indeed&nbsp;developed in ways that reflect this optimum: while Delaware courts eventually&nbsp;screen many lawsuits and rarely interfere with managers’ decisions, they do so&nbsp;only after providing plaintiffs with access to information-extracting tools in the&nbsp;early stages of the process.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark92"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark979"></a>7.4 How to Solve the Information-Underproduction Problem?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font21">Let us be clear on what we can or cannot infer from the reputation-through-litigation argument. The fact that the law can serve as a valuable source of media coverage does </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font21"> mean that we should outright ban secret settlements or make&nbsp;all discovery materials and arbitrations public. Discovery is so far-reaching in&nbsp;scope, and settlements so prevalent, that they beg discretion to allow&nbsp;confidentiality under certain conditions. Further, banning confidentiality may&nbsp;come with unintended effects of reducing the available flow of information </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">ex&nbsp;ante,</span><span class="font21"> for example, by pushing parties to settle out of court.— Nor can the&nbsp;reputation-through-litigation argument help us weigh considerations of privacy&nbsp;and proprietary or embarrassing information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">What the reputational perspective does offer is a more informed background against which judges and policymakers can balance the costs and&nbsp;benefits of confidentiality. Consider the following concrete proposals.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark980"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark981"></a>7.4.1 Lessons for Judges: Altering the Weighing of Public Interest and&nbsp;the Language Used</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Do not rubber-stump parties’ requests to seal information.</span><span class="font21"> First and most basically, the reputational framework invites judges’ attention to an&nbsp;underappreciated set of benefits - informational benefits. Open dispute&nbsp;resolution facilitates reputational deterrence and accountability journalism,&nbsp;which in turn facilitates greater accountability in society. The sealing of&nbsp;documents is usually governed by judicial doctrine, and in many states the&nbsp;doctrine includes weighing in the public interest in access to information versus&nbsp;considerations such as privacy and caseload management.— The law-as-source&nbsp;argument may tilt the scale in favor of the public interest in access, at least in&nbsp;cases that involve large manufacturers or employers whose behavior affect many&nbsp;third parties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Alter the language used to describe behavior.</span><span class="font21"> The reputational framework should also make judges consider altering the language they use to condemn&nbsp;wrongdoing. The legal system’s ability to produce valuable information to third&nbsp;parties depends not just on the documents that private parties extract but also on&nbsp;the language that judges use. In order for the information to affect third-parties’&nbsp;beliefs, it has to be not just available and accurate, but also accessible and&nbsp;comprehensible.— Adherence to rigid doctrines and technical language will hurt&nbsp;the potential to influence reputation. In areas where the demand for reputation-correcting is great, judges should therefore consider calibrating the legal&nbsp;language in a manner that is more relevant to market players. Think for example&nbsp;of moving from “liable/not liable” dichotomy to a “liability disproved”/“liability&nbsp;unproved”/“liability proved” system.<sup>44</sup></span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark982"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark983"></a>7.4.2 Lessons for Policymakers: Creating Databases and Information&nbsp;Safety Valves</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Create open databases.</span><span class="font21"> Beyond inviting judges’ attention and providing them with a road map to weigh law-as-source benefits, the reputational framework can&nbsp;also inform policymaking efforts. For example, our framework lends credence&nbsp;to, and underlines the importance of, existing proposals to create databases of&nbsp;lawsuits that were filed but settled and databases of arbitrated disputes.<sup>45</sup> We&nbsp;learned from interviews, tip sheets, and successful investigative projects, that&nbsp;pattern-identifying is perhaps the most important way in which the legal system&nbsp;helps investigative reporters. Accordingly, if we allow large companies to seal&nbsp;documents or use mandatory arbitration clauses, we should at least assure the&nbsp;documentation of the type and number of issues that were funneled to&nbsp;arbitration. Having a public record of the dispute would allow watchdogs to&nbsp;identify behavior that goes against the norms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Install an openness safety valve.</span><span class="font21"> Once databases of disputes are put in place, we can establish a mechanism or institution that will release further&nbsp;information about certain disputes. Think of it as analogous to an information&nbsp;escrow/safety valve: a mechanism that is in charge of releasing information that&nbsp;should not remain private.<sup>46</sup> Say a toddler car-seat manufacturer is being sued&nbsp;for product defects. The victims and the manufacturer then reach a secret&nbsp;settlement and keep information about the dispute private. Then, a second family&nbsp;sues the manufacturer over the same issue. Then a third. And so on. Under&nbsp;existing laws, chances are that each family would be unaware of the others, and&nbsp;that a journalist digging into the issue would not be able to grasp the scope and&nbsp;details - simply because information from each separate lawsuit remains hidden.&nbsp;Such was the case in the sexual-abuse cases in the Catholic Church. A way to&nbsp;mitigate the existing failure-to-warn problem without overburdening courts&nbsp;would be to pre-specify criteria under which the filing of additional disputes&nbsp;would trigger a mechanism that makes information about previous disputes&nbsp;publicly available.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">For the sake of illustration, assume that the fifth family filing a complaint over the same issue would trigger a release of the basic details of the previous&nbsp;four legal disputes involving the same defendant manufacturer over the same&nbsp;alleged product defect. Without getting into specific design details, the criteria&nbsp;for releasing information should be specified according to industry benchmarks:&nbsp;how many lawsuits are being filed on average against a physician in a given&nbsp;practice; how many lawsuits are usually filed against a manufacturer of a given&nbsp;product; and so on.<sup>47</sup> That way, reporters or future victims would be able to&nbsp;search for a pattern of recurring misbehavior and expose it.<sup>48</sup> The increased&nbsp;threat of being exposed as a low-quality manufacturer would incentivize&nbsp;manufacturers to invest in the safety of their products </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">ex ante.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Make FOIA great again.</span><span class="font21"> Finally, while our focus throughout this book has been on indirect channels of information production (i.e., law enforcement), we&nbsp;would be remiss if we did not discuss the most obvious way to improve&nbsp;information production, namely, revamping the direct sourcing channels. One&nbsp;could think, for example, about invigorating FOIA to make it easier on reporters&nbsp;and public-interest organizations to extract damning information about&nbsp;politicians. Yet, themes from the law-as-source study dovetail with others’&nbsp;observation that FOIA, even when executed properly, is an inherently&nbsp;problematic tool for promoting accountability.<sup>49</sup> Proposals for remedies should&nbsp;therefore not limit themselves to FOIA, but rather should extend to bolstering&nbsp;other sourcing channels, such as whistleblowing laws, or the indirect sourcing&nbsp;channels we have been discussing, such as openness of litigation. Concretely,&nbsp;this book suggests that the most important implication regarding FOIA is that if&nbsp;we are to promote accountability, we should reign the exemption for law&nbsp;enforcement records.—</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark94"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark984"></a>7.5 Reputation Is Not a Justification for&nbsp;Nonintervention</span></h4>
<p><span class="font21">The most basic policy implication stemming from recognizing the role of the law in facilitating reputational control is to adopt a more cautious approach to&nbsp;advocating for nonintervention. We noted this from the very first paragraph of&nbsp;the book: A strong strand of the economic analysis of law literature treats&nbsp;reputation as justification for nonintervention. Such analysis rests on the&nbsp;assumption that law and reputation are independent of and substitutes for each&nbsp;other. And so when we recognize an area with strong reputational forces, we can&nbsp;scale back legal intervention, or so the argument goes. Manufacturers already&nbsp;have incentives to invest optimally in the safety of their products, because they&nbsp;wish to avoid the risk of losing their reputation if bad news about their products&nbsp;breaks.<sup>51</sup> Maintaining a costly system of litigation is superfluous in an already&nbsp;existing market system of control.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Yet if this book has taught us anything, it is that strong reputational forces are largely a </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">result</span><span class="font21"> of product liability litigation and regulatory investigations.&nbsp;Virtually all investigative reporters’ tip sheets on how to cover faulty products&nbsp;include explicit orders to look for information from litigation. If we abolish&nbsp;litigation, we take away a large part of the media’s ability to scrutinize faulty&nbsp;products. Journalists rely on court documents to spot patterns that enable them to&nbsp;differentiate between one-off mistakes and systematic breakdowns or between&nbsp;genuine incompetence and clear disregard for consumers’ safety. The strength of&nbsp;market forces, at least in the area of product safety, is very much a result of the&nbsp;existing legal system.<sup>52</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">There is a broader point here. When we think of the design of legal institutions, we usually have in mind goals such as assuring compensation for&nbsp;victims or punishing wrongdoers to deter them. Yet in some contexts, we also&nbsp;need to take into account the indirect deterrence function of providing&nbsp;information that facilitates better reputational control. Those who allude to&nbsp;market forces when recommending policy solutions need to be aware of the role&nbsp;that media scrutiny plays in market discipline, and the role that the law plays in&nbsp;media scrutiny.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The Case against Mandatory Arbitration</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark97"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1037"></a>8.1 Introduction</span></h4>
<p><span class="font21">Throughout the 2010s, the Supreme Court of the United States has enforced contractual provisions that force arbitration of disputes and ban class actions.<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>Unsurprisingly, companies quickly went on to instill these mandatory arbitration&nbsp;provisions in their contracts with consumers, employees, and suppliers.<sup>2</sup> A&nbsp;heated debate ensued, bursting out of academic circles and into popular media,&nbsp;over the desirability of such mandatory arbitration revolution. Proponents argued&nbsp;it will improve efficiency, by streamlining dispute resolution and reducing&nbsp;lawyer fees. Opponents argued it will be unfair for the already disadvantaged&nbsp;workers, consumers, and suppliers, depriving them of their day in court. Yet the&nbsp;existing debate too often misses the forest for the trees. Instead of analyzing&nbsp;fairness and efficiency toward parties to a given dispute, we should focus on&nbsp;effects on the market overall. Even if shifting from litigation to arbitration would&nbsp;be good for a specific company </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">and</span><span class="font21"> its consumers/workers/investors,<sup>3</sup> such shift&nbsp;may prove detrimental to the market overall, because we would lose the positive&nbsp;externalities (in the form of quality information on corporate behavior) that&nbsp;come with litigation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">We saw in previous chapters that litigation facilitates market discipline. Litigation provides market players with information on corporate misconduct,&nbsp;thereby helping them avoid doing business with shady companies and&nbsp;businesspersons. But in a world where disputes are either diffused (because class&nbsp;action is banned) or funneled to behind-closed-doors arbitration, the flow of&nbsp;information is severally curtailed, and reputational deterrence loses its power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">To be sure, transforming our reputation-through-litigation argument into a case against mandatory arbitration is far from automatic. Before making the&nbsp;reputational case against mandatory arbitration, one needs to consider both the&nbsp;</span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">context</span><span class="font21"> and the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">counterfactual.</span><span class="font21"> In some areas, most of the law-as-source benefits&nbsp;come from direct channels such as FOIA or disclosure laws, rather than from&nbsp;litigation. In these contexts, moving away from litigation will not hurt&nbsp;reputational deterrence much. In other areas, FOIA or disclosure laws do not&nbsp;produce valuable information, but neither does litigation. Some types of&nbsp;litigation are simply not geared toward information production: think for&nbsp;example about certain doctrines that make plaintiffs less likely to survive the&nbsp;pleading stage and reach discovery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">And even if litigation in a given context does produce valuable information, we still need to consider the counterfactual: the possibility that, once we move&nbsp;away from litigation, other institutions would emerge to produce valuable&nbsp;information. For example, ramped-up public enforcement, or individual&nbsp;arbitration, may substitute the informational benefits we currently get from&nbsp;litigation, and at lower costs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The reputational case against mandatory arbitration is therefore highly context-specific. Accordingly, this chapter evaluates the desirability of&nbsp;mandatory arbitration in a specific context: shareholder claims in corporate and&nbsp;securities laws. As of this writing, corporate and securities litigation remain the&nbsp;last bastion where class actions still reign. But commentators, practitioners, and&nbsp;policymakers have suggested that the mandatory arbitration revolution can, and&nbsp;should, apply to shareholder litigation as well.</span><span class="font16">4 </span><span class="font21">The idea is that companies could&nbsp;amend their charters or bylaws to include such a provision, or go public with it,&nbsp;thereby forcing shareholders to arbitrate their claims individually, putting an end&nbsp;to shareholder litigation as we have come to know it. By delving into the details&nbsp;of such proposal in the shareholder litigation context, we get to extract more&nbsp;generalizable lessons to other contexts as well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Those in favor of market arbitration often base their argument on the notion that ending shareholder litigation as we came to know it is not a bad thing. They&nbsp;cite evidence on how shareholder litigation fares badly in compensating victims&nbsp;and amounts to little more than a transfer of wealth from investors to lawyers.&nbsp;Yet compensation is not the only measuring stick, or even the most important&nbsp;one. When evaluating a proposed shift from litigation to arbitration, we should&nbsp;also consider deterrence. The critical question is whether litigation has a salutary&nbsp;effect on corporate behavior. Litigation will have such a salutary effect&nbsp;whenever it makes defendants internalize the costs of their misbehavior.&nbsp;Importantly, litigation can make defendants behave better not just by threatening&nbsp;them with legal sanctions, but also indirectly, by threatening them with nonlegal&nbsp;sanctions. Litigation can exact (noninsurable) emotional costs. And it can&nbsp;facilitate reputational penalties: the risk of having damning information about&nbsp;how you behaved become public, thereby reducing the willingness of outside&nbsp;observers to trust and do business with you going forward. Allowing companies&nbsp;to force arbitration without class action in such a context would be a mistake.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The chapter proceeds in five sections. </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Section 8.2</span><span class="font21"> maps the contours of the existing mandatory arbitration debate. </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Section 8.3</span><span class="font21"> approaches the debate from a&nbsp;different angle, namely our reputation-through-litigation perspective. The&nbsp;section highlights how shareholder litigation, specifically, is more front-loaded&nbsp;than other types of litigation. The main event always comes early: think about&nbsp;the demand requirement in derivative actions or the pleading stage in securities&nbsp;class actions. As a result, plaintiffs in shareholder litigation find it harder to&nbsp;survive motions to dismiss and reach discovery. Yet, counterintuitively, that&nbsp;does not mean that shareholder litigation is less informative. Plaintiffs have&nbsp;developed prediscovery investigatory tools, such as requesting to inspect the&nbsp;company’s books and records or locating current or former employees willing to&nbsp;share damning information. These tools allow not just for better pleading but&nbsp;also for production of reputation-relevant information. </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Section 8.3</span><span class="font21"> also breaks&nbsp;down the differential reputational impact of various types of shareholder&nbsp;litigation: derivate actions, securities class actions, and deal litigation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Section 8.4</span><span class="font21"> considers the counterfactual: in a world with mandatory arbitration of shareholder claims, could other institutions substitute litigation’s&nbsp;informational benefits? This section assesses the information-production&nbsp;potential of enforcement by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC),&nbsp;individual arbitration by institutional investors, and standalone requests to&nbsp;inspect a company’s books and records, and finds them all wanting. SEC&nbsp;enforcement is geared toward maximizing enforcement numbers rather than&nbsp;information (as </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 4</span><span class="font21"> showed). Individual arbitration is geared toward&nbsp;confidentiality rather than openness. And any information gleaned from requests&nbsp;to inspect the company’s books has to remain confidential unless it is filed in&nbsp;conjunction with litigation. The upshot is that a shift to arbitration is bound to&nbsp;result in loss of informational benefits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Section 8.5</span><span class="font21"> sketches policy implications. Recognizing the informational role of litigation puts a thumb on the scales against importing mandatory&nbsp;arbitration provisions to corporate and securities laws. If courts and regulators&nbsp;nevertheless decide to enforce such provisions, we should at a minimum set&nbsp;basic rules ensuring that shareholder arbitration would produce meaningful&nbsp;information. For example, we can mandate “explained awards,” whereby the&nbsp;arbitrator provides a short, publicly available factual description of what&nbsp;happened, as well as reasoning for her decision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Section 8.6</span><span class="font21"> offers concluding thoughts on the applicability of the reputational case against mandatory arbitration more generally, beyond the&nbsp;shareholder litigation context. The section uses specific examples from labor&nbsp;law, which illustrate how a shift to arbitration would have different effects on&nbsp;different markets. I then use examples spurred by the #MeToo movement to&nbsp;highlight the other side: instead of looking at how a shift to arbitration will affect&nbsp;reputation, looking at how reputational concerns affect firms’ decisions to adopt&nbsp;mandatory arbitration provisions to begin with.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark99"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1038"></a>8.2 The Existing Debate</span></h4>
<p><span class="font21">Mandatory arbitration of shareholder claims is hardly a new topic. But the contours of the debate have recently changed. The existing literature has focused&nbsp;on whether arbitration provisions are consistent with state and federal laws.<sup>5&nbsp;</sup>Historically, companies considering adopting such provisions had to anticipate&nbsp;facing opposition from the courts and, notably, the SEC. But the line of Supreme&nbsp;Court pro-arbitration decisions, coupled with the Trump administration&nbsp;pressuring the SEC to change its anti-arbitration stance, now signal to companies&nbsp;wishing to adopt such provisions that any remaining legal hurdles will be&nbsp;cleared.</span><span class="font16">6 </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Section 8.2.1</span><span class="font21"> elaborates.</span></p>
<p class="font21">Assuming the legal hurdles are cleared, should companies adopt arbitration provisions? Should the SEC give in to pressures and approve them? <span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Section</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><a name="bookmark1039"></a><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">8.2.2</span><span class="font21"> details the existing policy arguments. The extant debate evaluates the&nbsp;desirability of arbitration by reference to the benchmark - the current state of&nbsp;shareholder litigation. Proponents of the shift to arbitration suggest it will leave&nbsp;investors better off, simply because litigation currently offers them very little&nbsp;compensation with very high fees. Notably missing from the debate, however, is&nbsp;a full account of litigation’s deterrence benefits.</span></p></li></ul>
<h5><a name="bookmark1040"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1041"></a>8.2.1 Is Mandatory Arbitration Good Law?</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">Historically, companies wishing to adopt mandatory arbitration provisions for shareholder claims anticipated facing a slew of legal hurdles. The SEC had&nbsp;steadfastly opposed such provisions, viewing them as a violation of the securities&nbsp;laws’ “anti-waiver” provisions.<sup>7</sup> In 2012, for example, the SEC pressured&nbsp;private-equity giant Carlyle to drop a mandatory arbitration provision before it&nbsp;signed off on the company’s IPO plans and allowed companies to exclude from&nbsp;their proxy materials shareholder proposals to adopt such provisions.<sup>8</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Getting courts to sign off on arbitration provisions was also far from given. The Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) enforces arbitration provisions among&nbsp;contractual parties. It was not clear whether corporate governance documents&nbsp;would be considered contracts for FAA purposes, if only because they lack the&nbsp;key feature of bargaining between arm’s-length counterparties.</span><span class="font16">9 </span><span class="font21">A more recent&nbsp;challenge came in 2015, when the Delaware legislature amended its corporate&nbsp;law to allow forum-exclusion bylaws only if they do not exclude Delaware’s&nbsp;courts.<sup>10</sup> A sweeping arbitration provision would run against such law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">In recent years, however, the legal hurdles started clearing. In 2011, the Supreme Court handed down its </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">AT&amp;TMobility LLC v. Concepcion—</span><span class="font21"> decision,&nbsp;enforcing an arbitration provision with a class action waiver, while ruling that&nbsp;the FAA trumps state contract law. Contract law, like corporate law, is&nbsp;considered the domain of the states, but that did not stop the Court.<sup>12</sup> Then in&nbsp;2013, the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">American Express Co. v. Italian Colors Restaurant—</span><span class="font21"> decision upheld&nbsp;</span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Concepcion</span><span class="font21"> and further expanded the FAA’s scope by enforcing the arbitration&nbsp;clause even when it renders a </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">federal</span><span class="font21"> law (the Sherman Act) ineffective. In both&nbsp;decisions the issue of consent seems to take a backseat to a more policy-oriented&nbsp;approach. Consumers of cell phone plans cannot bargain their way out of take-it-or-leave-it arbitration provisions, yet the Court enforced these provisions on&nbsp;them, suggesting that arbitration is the more effective procedure to handle their&nbsp;disputes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Concepcion</span><span class="font21"> and </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Italian Colors Restaurant</span><span class="font21"> decisions did more than just signal the lowering of legal hurdles. They also significantly increased the&nbsp;benefits of fighting any remaining legal uncertainties for companies; the real&nbsp;innovation was not in respecting arbitration provisions, but rather in enforcing&nbsp;the class action waivers in these provisions.<sup>14</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">A similar pro-arbitration turn may be taking place inside the SEC, with nudges from the Trump administration.— In 2017, the US Treasury prepared a&nbsp;report (in response to Executive Order 13,772) on how to relax regulations that&nbsp;stymie activity in capital markets.<sup>16</sup> The Treasury report identified reducing the&nbsp;costs of litigation as a key step toward reinvigorating US stock listings and&nbsp;recommended that the SEC investigate a shift to arbitration. The media has since&nbsp;reported that the Trump administration keeps pushing the SEC to reverse its anti-arbitration stance and that the SEC now privately signals to companies its&nbsp;willingness to change course.<sup>17</sup> In July 2017, then-SEC Commissioner Michael&nbsp;Piwowar floated the idea in a public speech<sup>18</sup>: “For shareholder lawsuits,&nbsp;companies can come to us to ask for relief to put in mandatory arbitration into&nbsp;their charter ... I would encourage companies to come and talk to us about&nbsp;that.”<sup>19</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Given this evident pro-arbitration bent, mandatory arbitration provisions are now much more likely to be considered consistent with state and federal laws.&nbsp;Why have we yet to see companies rushing to adopt them? We can conjecture&nbsp;that there is a first-mover disadvantage that companies fear. The first company&nbsp;that adopts such a provision will expose itself to the costs associated with&nbsp;defending its stance in the courtroom and the court of public opinion.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">However, once the first test case proves successful, there is reason to expect many other companies to follow.— Is that a good thing?</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark1042"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1043"></a>8.2.2 Is Mandatory Arbitration Good Policy?</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">Those in favor of shifting to mandatory arbitration usually make their case by criticizing the existing state of shareholder litigation. Shareholder litigation has&nbsp;two main rationales: compensation and deterrence.<sup>22</sup> By now there is wide&nbsp;agreement that shareholder litigation fares badly on the first prong:&nbsp;compensation.<sup>23</sup> The recoveries that shareholder plaintiffs get are nominal.<sup>24&nbsp;</sup>And in the rare cases where compensation is not nominal, critiques continue, it is&nbsp;circular.<sup>25</sup> That is, because the company itself (directly or through insurance) is&nbsp;the one often compensating the plaintiffs, the costs are borne by the company’s&nbsp;existing shareholders. Diversified investors are therefore as likely to receive&nbsp;payment as plaintiffs, as they are to pay as defendants. Once you factor in the&nbsp;transaction costs of litigation (notably, lawyers’ fees), many scholars conclude&nbsp;that shareholder litigation merely transfers wealth from investors to lawyers.<sup>26&nbsp;</sup>Against this background, mandatory-arbitration proponents claim that a shift to&nbsp;arbitration will actually improve things for consumers/investors. Arbitration will&nbsp;generate higher monetary reliefs with lower transaction costs (a quicker, more&nbsp;cost-effective procedure).</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">A glaring weakness in the existing arguments for arbitration and against litigation is the lack of attention to the other social goal of litigation, namely,&nbsp;deterrence.<sup>27</sup> This is a broader issue: most empirical work on shareholder&nbsp;litigation focuses on compensation, leaving deterrence understudied.<sup>28</sup> In the&nbsp;arbitration versus litigation debate, those favoring arbitration bypass the lack of&nbsp;evidence by assuming that little compensation translates into weak deterrence.<sup>29&nbsp;</sup>A perfect illustration comes from the abovementioned Treasury report: the report&nbsp;mentions the possibility that securities class actions contribute to deterrence,&nbsp;only to quickly dismiss it by invoking the low-and-circular compensation point,</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">and then calls for considering a shift to arbitration.<sup>30</sup> While it is understandable that difficulties in measuring deterrence make it much less amenable to&nbsp;empirical work, deterrence is simply too important to be ignored or lumped&nbsp;together with compensation.<sup>31</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Deterrence does not hinge solely on compensation. Litigation can impose costs on defendants - making them internalize the social costs of their&nbsp;misconduct - even without compensating plaintiffs. Pertinently, litigation can&nbsp;expose defendants to nonlegal (and uninsurable) sanctions. It can impose&nbsp;emotional costs on defendants.<sup>32</sup> And it can hurt their reputations. In other&nbsp;words, when assessing deterrence, we need to consider both direct- and indirect-deterrence effects of facilitating nonlegal sanctions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The existing arguments </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">against</span><span class="font21"> mandatory arbitration tend to ignore the indirect-deterrence angle. One common type of criticism emphasizes the adverse&nbsp;effects of arbitration on plaintiffs in specific disputes. The arbitration procedure&nbsp;is tilted in favor of defendants, who get to pick their favorite arbitrators and&nbsp;curtail discovery, the argument goes.<sup>33</sup> Shifting to arbitration may result in more&nbsp;meritorious claims getting barred to begin with or in a transfer from small to&nbsp;large shareholders.<sup>34</sup> These criticisms are mostly generic and well debated, and I&nbsp;have little to add.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">This book raises another type of concern, namely, the adverse effects of arbitration on third parties. There exist ample accounts that highlight the positive&nbsp;externalities of litigation that will be lost if we shift to mandatory arbitration. Yet&nbsp;most of these arguments emphasize “legal” externalities. That is, they claim that&nbsp;litigation cultivates a vibrant, constantly evolving law that can instruct corporate&nbsp;behavior.<sup>35</sup> This book spotlights a different version of positive externalities:&nbsp;nonlegal externalities. Litigation, in our version, does not just help potential&nbsp;defendants plan ahead and avoid legal landmines; it does not just help regulators&nbsp;prioritize better; it also helps market players - consumers, suppliers, and&nbsp;investors - make better decisions regarding with whom to keep doing business.<sup>36&nbsp;</sup>The </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">next section</span><span class="font21"> elaborates.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark101"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1044"></a>8.3 How Shifting to Arbitration Affects the&nbsp;Market for Reputation</span></h4>
<p><span class="font21">Applying the reputational framework to the issue of mandatory arbitration is not automatic, and requires context-specific examination. This section hones in on&nbsp;the context: we start by asking to what extent does media scrutiny matter for&nbsp;corporate governance issues? If it matters greatly, to what extent does&nbsp;shareholder litigation affect said media scrutiny? How does specific doctrines of&nbsp;corporate and securities laws affect information production in litigation? And&nbsp;how do specific types of shareholder litigation differ from each other in terms of&nbsp;information production?</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark1045"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1046"></a>8.3.1 Media Scrutiny Matters for Corporate Governance</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">Commercial legal scholars have traditionally understudied issues of how information is diffused, and what role the media plays in corporate&nbsp;governance.<sup>37</sup> Yet a nascent-but-burgeoning literature in other fields keeps&nbsp;producing evidence on the effects of agenda-setting, framing, and diffusion by&nbsp;the media. That literature highlights just how significant the role of the media is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Communication scholars categorize the media’s impact into capital-markets effects and corporate-governance effects.<sup>38</sup> Within the former category, financial&nbsp;economists have shown that the scope and tone of media coverage moves stock&nbsp;market prices even when the media reports contain no new information. One&nbsp;classic study found that a front-page </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span><span class="font21"> article about a biotech&nbsp;company caused the stock prices to skyrocket, even though the article contained&nbsp;no new information and was actually repeating information that the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font21"> had&nbsp;previously published in a back-page story.<sup>39</sup> More broadly, the intensity of&nbsp;media coverage was found to be conducive to the quality of financial markets.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Within the latter category - corporate-governance effects - studies find that media scrutiny increases the responsiveness of corporate decision makers to&nbsp;shareholders,<sup>41</sup> as well as to salient outside groups, such as environmentalists.<sup>42&nbsp;</sup>Survey-based evidence shows that top managers view negative media coverage&nbsp;as the biggest threat to corporate reputation.<sup>43</sup> Pertinently, a recent study found&nbsp;that media coverage of corporate misconduct creates financial risk: one negative&nbsp;article brings with it an increase in credit risk in the magnitude of about $1.3&nbsp;million in additional servicing of debt.<sup>44</sup> In fact, the law itself acknowledges the&nbsp;key role of the media in disciplining corporate behavior. The doctrine developed&nbsp;in </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Caremark,</span><span class="font21"> for example, treats prior media coverage as a red flag that should&nbsp;propel directors to act or indicate that their internai monitoring channels were&nbsp;not functioning.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Once we recognize the salutary effect of media scrutiny on corporate behavior, the question becomes what determines media scrutiny. In particular,&nbsp;we are interested in the link between corporate litigation and media coverage.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark1047"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1048"></a>8.3.2 Corporate Litigation Matters for Media Scrutiny</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">Before we can apply the law-as-source insights from </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 2</span><span class="font21"> to our topic here, we need to answer two questions. First, to what extent do law-as-source benefits&nbsp;stem from the specific channel of litigation, rather than from other legal sources&nbsp;such as disclosure requirements or regulatory enforcement? After all, we are&nbsp;interested in the desirability of shifting to mandatory arbitration, and disclosure&nbsp;or public enforcement will supposedly remain intact even if such a shift occurs.&nbsp;Second, to what extent are the law-as-source benefits of litigation relevant to our&nbsp;particular type, namely, shareholder litigation?</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The law-as-source study detailed in </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 2</span><span class="font21"> above provides a clear answer to the first question: litigation plays a key role in holding business&nbsp;companies and businesspersons to account, often more important than other&nbsp;types of legal sources. Granted, some media probes rely heavily on “direct” legal&nbsp;sources, such as companies’ public filings with the SEC. But a lot of times, the&nbsp;smoking gun comes rather from “indirect” legal sources, such as law&nbsp;enforcement actions. As </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 2</span><span class="font21"> elaborated, the reason is that litigation does&nbsp;not rely on powerful players volunteering damning information about&nbsp;themselves - it forces damning information out of powerful players.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The second question - whether shareholder litigation is as informative as other types of litigation - is harder to answer. The law-as-source study does not&nbsp;answer it directly, if only because Pulitzer prizes are rarely awarded for covering&nbsp;corporate governance issues, and so the content analysis of prizewinning&nbsp;projects does not provide many relevant data points. What the law-as-source&nbsp;study does offer in that regard are more general observations regarding how the&nbsp;media relies on information from litigation when it investigates companies.<sup>46</sup> It&nbsp;seems that litigation’s role is actually more pronounced in investigative reporting&nbsp;on corporate behavior, as opposed to investigative reporting on the public sector&nbsp;or the third sector. Virtually every reporters’ tip sheet or course syllabus that&nbsp;deals with how to investigate businesses mentions searching court documents.&nbsp;When I asked investigative reporters why this is so, they suggested a&nbsp;straightforward answer: business journalists rely more heavily on court&nbsp;documents because they have a hard time sourcing stories on business&nbsp;companies in other ways.</span><span class="font16">47 </span><span class="font21">A journalist trying to hold big government to&nbsp;account will have a much easier time getting, for example, tips from the&nbsp;politician’s rivals or relying on FOIA requests or public-records laws.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The added difficulty of getting information on private businesses seems to increase the demand for getting information from litigation. And, in the words of&nbsp;the Dean of Columbia Journalism School, the supply tends to meet the demand:&nbsp;“[T]here’s hardly a company in this world that is not being sued, and this is&nbsp;where you get a window [into what is going on in the company].”<sup>49</sup> A great&nbsp;illustration comes from a study that documented the lack of watchdog journalism&nbsp;by the financial media leading up to the 2008 financial crisis. That study singled&nbsp;out four counterexamples of great investigative pieces.<sup>50</sup> When I took a closer&nbsp;look at these projects - the rare pieces that did spotlight the shady Wall Street&nbsp;practices that contributed to the crisis - I learned that all of them relied heavily&nbsp;on court documents.<sup>51</sup> Without litigation, media scrutiny of corporate behavior&nbsp;would lose most of its already-diminished effectiveness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Up to this point, we have broadly discussed litigation against businesses. Yet different types of litigation produce information of different quantities and&nbsp;qualities. Shareholder litigation works differently than, say, product liability&nbsp;litigation. And within shareholder litigation, derivative suits work differently&nbsp;than securities class actions. It is time to delve into specifics and introduce the&nbsp;unique nuances of information production in shareholder litigation.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark1049"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1050"></a>8.3.3 Front-Loaded Information Production</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">Shareholder litigation is more front-loaded than other types of litigation. Since the mid-1990s, a series of legislative and judicial reforms have severely curtailed&nbsp;a plaintiffs ability to survive the motion to dismiss stage, let alone reach full-blown discovery.— One could claim that this feature makes it less likely that&nbsp;shareholder litigation would produce valuable information. How can we expect&nbsp;useful information to come out from litigation if only a few complaints reach&nbsp;discovery, and even fewer lead to published judicial opinions? Without the&nbsp;benefit of discovery, how can litigators add information that other market&nbsp;players do not already know?</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The answer is straightforward: Reforms that made it tougher to survive earlier stages in litigation did not eliminate the information production, but&nbsp;merely </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">front-loaded</span><span class="font21"> it. Plaintiffs in shareholder litigation conduct much more&nbsp;prefiling, prediscovery investigations, and file more fact-rich, detailed initial&nbsp;complaints.— As a result, information about defendants’ behavior is generated at&nbsp;much earlier stages of the litigation process. Shareholder litigation affects the&nbsp;market for reputation even in its infancy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The front-loaded information production takes different degrees and forms, as a function of the forum and type of claim. With corporate governance matters&nbsp;settled in state courts, the main prediscovery investigatory tool is requesting to&nbsp;inspect the defendant company’s books and records (“section 220 requests,” to&nbsp;use the Delaware jargon).— With securities claims settled in federal courts,&nbsp;section 220 requests are unavailable, and so plaintiffs frequently resort to&nbsp;soliciting inside informants, who confidentially provide damning information&nbsp;about their current or former employers.</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark1051"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">8.3.3.1 Corporate Claims in State Courts: Section 220 Requests</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font21">In derivative actions, the main event comes before the suit even starts: the demand requirement.<sup>55</sup> To survive the demand-requirement stage, plaintiffs&nbsp;practically need to convince the courts that demand is futile because the&nbsp;company’s board is too self-interested to make the right decision.<sup>56</sup> To do that,&nbsp;plaintiffs need to meet a heightened pleading standard and show that a majority&nbsp;of the board is implicated in the alleged wrongdoing.<sup>57</sup> And they need to clear&nbsp;those hurdles without having the benefits of discovery.<sup>58</sup> The solution to this&nbsp;pleading challenge came from the Delaware courts, which started imploring&nbsp;plaintiffs to use all “tools at hand” to generate information pre-suit, particularly&nbsp;their right to inspect the company’s books.<sup>59</sup> Plaintiffs heeded the call and&nbsp;started filing section 220 requests more frequently and more broadly.<sup>60</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Granted, section 220 requests do not generate the same quantity and quality of information as full discovery does.<sup>61</sup> But the practice of section 220 requests&nbsp;has developed such that shareholders now use them not just to get technical&nbsp;information such as stock-list materials, but also to extract all internal company&nbsp;documents related to the alleged wrongdoing, such as board minutes, internal&nbsp;memos, and spreadsheets. Forcing companies to volunteer such information can&nbsp;affect reputations, both directly and indirectly. Directly, section 220 requests that&nbsp;produce internal corporate communications give the market a peek behind the&nbsp;corporate curtain, with answers to reputation-relevant questions such as “who&nbsp;knew what when.” Indirectly, section 220 requests allow better pleading and so&nbsp;increase the chances of reaching full discovery, where more relevant information&nbsp;is likely to come out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">To illustrate, we need simply recast the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Disney</span><span class="font21"> case. There, the initial complaint was dismissed for failure to meet the demand requirement.<sup>62</sup> The&nbsp;plaintiffs regrouped and submitted a section 220 request, which generated&nbsp;internal company documents: letters, emails, memoranda, and board minutes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Armed with the information, the plaintiffs amended their complaint, and this time survived the motion to dismiss, proceeded to discovery and then a full&nbsp;trial.<sup>63</sup> </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 3</span><span class="font21"> showed how earlier stages in the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Disney</span><span class="font21"> litigation shaped the&nbsp;frequency and tenor of media coverage of the Disney-Ovitz debacle. Now we&nbsp;can add the important detail of how: it was the prediscovery, section 220&nbsp;requests that facilitated the reputational effects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">8.3.32 Securities Claims in Federal Courts: Soliciting Whistleblowers</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">With securities class actions, the main event similarly comes early: the motion to dismiss.<sup>64</sup> Out of the many challenges that securities class actions faced over the&nbsp;recent decades, most relevant for our purposes is the combination of heightened&nbsp;pleading standards with a stay on discovery.<sup>65</sup> The 1995 Private Securities&nbsp;Litigation Reform Act (PSLRA) requires that plaintiffs plead facts with&nbsp;particularity, showing a strong inference of scienter.<sup>66</sup> Such facts about the&nbsp;defendant’ s state of mind must be pled without the benefit of discovery, as the&nbsp;PSLRA also stayed discovery until after the motion to dismiss is decided. As a&nbsp;result, virtually all defendants file motions to dismiss, and plaintiffs have a tough&nbsp;time surviving such motions.<sup>67</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The combination of heightened pleading standards and stayed discovery seems at first glance like a death knell to information production. Yet here as&nbsp;well, a closer look reveals a different, more dynamic story. Plaintiffs’ lawyers&nbsp;who faced mounting hurdles had to raise their game and conduct more pre-complaint and prediscovery investigations.— They are now said to possess much&nbsp;more information in the motion to dismiss stage, relative to plaintiffs in other&nbsp;cases, and are more likely to plead their allegations in an “awesomely detailed”&nbsp;way.<sup>69</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Unlike in corporate litigation, section 220 requests were not available to plaintiffs, since the law blocks their usage in securities litigation.<sup>70</sup> Plaintiffs had&nbsp;to resort to alternative investigatory tools. Among them, the most common and&nbsp;effective seems to be soliciting whistleblowing: finding current and former&nbsp;employees willing to share damning inside information on the behavior of&nbsp;defendants.<sup>71</sup> Indeed, reliance on “information provided by confidential&nbsp;witnesses” has become almost universal in securities class actions.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">These inside informants frequently provide information that outside observers are not privy to, regarding what and how things happened. To&nbsp;illustrate:— In </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Tsirekidze v. Syntax-Brillian Corp.,—</span><span class="font21"> a former top officer&nbsp;provided details on how defendants cooked the books. In </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Silverman v. Motorola,&nbsp;Inc.</span><span class="font21"> ,— eight former employees explained how the company knowingly omitted&nbsp;facts about technological difficulties. In </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Hubbard v. BankAtlantic Bancorp,&nbsp;Inc.</span><span class="font21">,<sup>76</sup> former bank employees fleshed out claims about shady lending practices.&nbsp;As with section 220 requests, the usage of such insider informants affects the&nbsp;market for reputation both indirectly by increasing the chances that complaints&nbsp;reach full discovery, and directly by providing information that can be picked up&nbsp;by the media even at a preliminary stage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Another element that makes the preliminary stages in securities class actions informative is that the judges themselves are more proactive in&nbsp;generating information. Because the motion to dismiss effectively turned into&nbsp;something akin to a summary judgment, judges examine the pleading with much&nbsp;more rigor. And because courts in securities class actions must investigate all&nbsp;sources of competing inferences of scienter, they often probe even information&nbsp;that was not included in the initial complaint.<sup>77</sup></span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark103"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1052"></a>8.4 Can Other Institutions Substitute&nbsp;Litigation's Informational Benefits?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font21">To fully examine the desirability of shifting to mandatory arbitration, we need to consider not just the informational benefits of litigation in its current state, but&nbsp;also the counterfactual: in a world without shareholder litigation, will other&nbsp;enforcement mechanisms step up and provide similar informational benefits to&nbsp;the ones we currently get from litigation? This section considers three such&nbsp;alternatives for information production: public enforcement headed by the SEC,&nbsp;individual arbitration headed by big institutional investors, and section 220&nbsp;requests or whistleblowing by aggrieved shareholders and employees. The&nbsp;bottom line is the same: none of these institutions would be able to meaningfully&nbsp;substitute the information that would be lost if we switch from litigation to&nbsp;arbitration.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark1053"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1054"></a>8.4.1 SEC Enforcement</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">One could argue that in a world where private enforcement happens behind closed doors, public enforcement can still produce enough information to&nbsp;facilitate proper reputational deterrence. The SEC’s enforcement division&nbsp;arguably possesses better tools and incentives than private litigants to produce&nbsp;credible information. The SEC enjoys broader investigative powers compared to&nbsp;the ones private litigants typically enjoy in a post-PSLRA world.<sup>78</sup> Private&nbsp;litigants, as the previous chapter detailed, are incentivized to trade away&nbsp;information for money: it is not just that they settle too early and often, but also&nbsp;that they settle too secretly. Almost every settlement comes with some form of a&nbsp;confidentiality clause. By contrast, the SEC can produce press releases that&nbsp;detail their investigations in a fairer way than plaintiffs’-lawyer-worded&nbsp;complaints or media briefs. A shift from litigation to arbitration would therefore&nbsp;only crystalize the waters, as the information environment would be dominated&nbsp;by the better-informed and more credible SEC’s enforcement division.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Yet we have already rebutted the argument that SEC enforcement can fully substitute for the information that comes out of private litigation, in </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 4&nbsp;</span><span class="font21">above. We discussed there why the argument may hold only in a limited sense:&nbsp;in a specific dispute, SEC enforcement may indeed be equally or more&nbsp;informative than private litigation. But from a big-picture perspective, private&nbsp;enforcement produces information in ways and on types of misconduct on which&nbsp;the SEC consistently underproduces information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">A quick recap of the factors we detailed in </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 4</span><span class="font21">: First, the SEC faces budgetary constraints, and simply cannot pursue all instances of misconduct.&nbsp;Second, when the SEC prioritizes targets for enforcement, it tends to go after the&nbsp;small fish, less politically connected firms. Third, the SEC maximizes the&nbsp;observable yardsticks of the total amount of fines it collects and the number of&nbsp;enforcement actions it opens, which leads the agency to leave information on the&nbsp;table, in various ways. For example, the SEC lets defendants who are willing to&nbsp;settle early and for nice sums dictate the language and timing of the enforcement&nbsp;action press release. And it targets whole industries for minor, strict-liability-type offenses, which typically do not extract relevant internal documents from&nbsp;the defendant-companies. All these practices, </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 4</span><span class="font21"> showed, limit the&nbsp;reputational value of SEC enforcement. It is telling that even SEC&nbsp;commissioners and staffers have long acknowledged that private litigation&nbsp;guards against selective enforcement and inaction on part of the SEC.<sup>79</sup> In a&nbsp;world without private litigation, defendants would have stronger incentives to&nbsp;dilute SEC enforcement efforts.— This will dilute not just legal deterrence but&nbsp;also reputational deterrence.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark1055"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1056"></a>8.4.2 Individual Arbitration</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">One common criticism of mandatory arbitration provisions with class action waivers goes as follows: these provisions do not merely change the procedure&nbsp;for settling disputes, but rather effectively eliminate disputes, since victims who&nbsp;suffered small damages will not pursue their claims individually.— At first&nbsp;glance, such criticism applies less forcefully in our context, where there are big&nbsp;institutional investors that may have a large enough stake to vigorously pursue&nbsp;individual claims in arbitration. In a world without class actions, institutional&nbsp;investors may even have a legal duty to monitor and follow through on potential&nbsp;misconduct by companies they invest in.<sup>82</sup> The question for our purposes is not&nbsp;whether individual arbitration by institutional investors would generate enough&nbsp;compensation, but rather whether it would generate enough information. I tend&nbsp;to answer in the negative, for the following reasons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">For one, fewer instances of corporate misconduct will get flushed out. The whole impetus behind the arbitration-provisions wave is wanting to </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">avoid</span><span class="font21"> the&nbsp;need to resolve certain disputes.<sup>83</sup> Even in cases where the individual harm is big&nbsp;enough on paper, it is not clear that institutional investors would actually pursue&nbsp;a remedy. Evidence from Europe, where only big institutional investors can&nbsp;bring derivative actions, suggest that in reality most valuable claims are not&nbsp;pursued, partly because it is easier for managers to collude and convince the few&nbsp;players who can bring a claim to not bring it.<sup>84</sup> Similarly, in the United States,&nbsp;Professors Bebchuk and Hirst showed that none of the large index funds had&nbsp;been the lead plaintiff in </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">any</span><span class="font21"> securities class action over the past ten years.<sup>85&nbsp;</sup>They interpret this evidence as suggesting that institutional investors with high-enough stakes prefer, for various reasons, not to vigorously pursue their claims.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Even if one assumes that institutional investors would regularly pursue claims in arbitration, one has to acknowledge that the procedure in arbitration&nbsp;starkly differs from court procedures in ways that limit information production.<sup>86&nbsp;</sup>Discovery tends to be </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">much</span><span class="font21"> more limited. Depositions are taken only rarely.&nbsp;Plaintiffs’ investigations normally do not extract internal company documents.&nbsp;And so on. In theory, arbitration provisions can be amended to demand a more&nbsp;information-extracting, akin-to-litigation procedure. But that would defeat the&nbsp;purpose behind the wave of arbitration provisions.<sup>87</sup> A key purpose in shifting to&nbsp;arbitration, besides eliminating disputes, is limiting the negative publicity from&nbsp;disputes. Confidentiality and privacy are hallmark features in the arbitration&nbsp;procedure. It is therefore hard to imagine companies agreeing to an expansive&nbsp;discovery regime in arbitration.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark1057"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1058"></a>8.4.3 Section 220 Requests and Whistleblowing</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">As noted above, filing section 220 requests and finding inside informants are two important investigatory tools in shareholder litigation. One could claim that&nbsp;we do not need litigation to employ these channels of extracting information.&nbsp;These are </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">prefiling</span><span class="font21"> investigatory tools, after all, which would supposedly remain&nbsp;available even if we switch to mandatory arbitration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The argument that standalone section 220 requests (not in conjunction with litigation) can substitute the informational benefits of litigation is easily&nbsp;refutable. It is inconsistent with the logic of incentives and inconsistent with the&nbsp;law. There is a good reason that section 220 requests are usually filed in&nbsp;conjunction with litigation. A shareholder would be willing to go through the&nbsp;costs and trouble of fighting companies for information only when said&nbsp;shareholder (or, more realistically, a plaintiffs law firm) anticipates a potential&nbsp;financial bonanza down the road. Shareholder litigation provides the&nbsp;supercharged economic incentives needed to make the fight worth it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Even if we assume proper incentives for filing standalone section 220 requests, the law makes such requests irrelevant from an information-production&nbsp;standpoint. The courts have conditioned granting section 220 requests on&nbsp;confidentiality.— If a shareholder wants to enjoy her rights to inspect the books,&nbsp;she must first agree to not diffuse the information she receives. As a result, the&nbsp;only time when section 220 information escapes confidentiality and becomes&nbsp;available is when the requesting shareholder uses the information in conjunction&nbsp;with court filings, such as the initial complaint or as attachments to a motion. In&nbsp;other words, information gleaned from section 220 requests can only affect&nbsp;reputations when it is filed with the court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The argument that standalone whistleblowing would replace litigation’s informational benefits is harder to refute. There is no law prohibiting the release&nbsp;of information coming from whistleblowers outside litigation, and the incentives&nbsp;problem has supposedly been addressed in the Dodd-Frank Act.— Still, there&nbsp;exist ample indications that without litigation, the whistleblowing would not&nbsp;make an impact. Litigation adds value to the information revealed by&nbsp;amplifying, certifying, and diffusing whistleblowers’ claims. To illustrate,&nbsp;consider </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Freund v. Lucent Technologies, Inc.,—</span><span class="font21"> where plaintiffs submitted a&nbsp;section 220 request for all the materials that were filed in a whistleblowing&nbsp;action (brought by a former senior official who had been fired in retaliation).&nbsp;While the initial whistleblowing did not reverberate publicly, the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Lucent&nbsp;</span><span class="font21">litigation made the whistleblower’s information more salient and coverable by&nbsp;the media.<sup>91</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">As the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Lucent</span><span class="font21"> example illustrates, without litigation, such whistleblowing would be akin to a tree falling in the forest where no one is around - did it really&nbsp;make a sound? With litigation, the whistle gets widely echoed by the press.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark105"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1059"></a>8.5 Implications</span></h4>
<p><span class="font21">The policy implication of this chapter’s analysis is straightforward: recognizing the informational role of litigation puts a thumb on the scales against enforcing&nbsp;mandatory arbitration for shareholder claims. If policymakers and courts&nbsp;nevertheless decide to enforce arbitration provisions, we need to design&nbsp;arbitration procedures that allow more information to come out from arbitration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">At the same time, I want to be careful not to overstate my claim. There are two important qualifications. First, any evidence for the informational benefits of&nbsp;litigation is more qualitative in nature. We know that reputation matters, we&nbsp;know that media scrutiny matters, and we know that litigation matters to media&nbsp;scrutiny and reputation. But we have not yet quantified how much exactly it&nbsp;matters: What is the size of these informational benefits of litigation? Second,&nbsp;and relatedly, even if one is convinced that the size of the informational benefits&nbsp;is significant, one still needs to weigh them against the significant costs of&nbsp;litigation.<sup>92</sup> After all, our aim is not to maximize production of information, but&nbsp;rather to optimize it. Perhaps the tradeoff that mandatory arbitration offers - less&nbsp;informational benefits with less administrative costs - is worth it from a societal&nbsp;perspective. Against this background, let us go back to what we started this short&nbsp;section with: the two immediate policy implications.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">First and most basically, the information-production argument puts a thumb on the scales against mandatory arbitration. A thumb on the scales and not a&nbsp;decisive vote, because we only have suggestive evidence. But what we have is&nbsp;enough to caution against replacing litigation with arbitration without first&nbsp;gaining better evidence and a better understanding of the positive externalities of&nbsp;litigation. Securities markets are fraught with asymmetric information and&nbsp;supercharged incentives to cheat. Reputational deterrence is important to their&nbsp;proper functioning. And litigation seems to be important to the proper&nbsp;functioning of reputational deterrence. The direct costs of litigation are well&nbsp;researched and salient to us, while the costs of reputational </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">under-deterrence</span><span class="font21"> are&nbsp;not. If one has to conjecture, I would surmise that the latter far outweigh the&nbsp;former.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">If courts and regulators nevertheless allow companies to adopt arbitration provisions, the second set of policy implications comes in: providing insight into&nbsp;how we would want such arbitration to look. Ideally, in the area of corporate and&nbsp;securities laws we would want arbitration that injects some valuable information&nbsp;into the market. Is there a way to get the cost-saving aspects of arbitration&nbsp;without losing the information-extracting benefits of litigation?</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">At a minimum, we would want an accessible database of disputes with “explained awards” - arbitrators should include a short summary of who did&nbsp;what to whom, when, and why that is a bad thing. The requirement of explained&nbsp;awards should come from, and be monitored by, the SEC or another regulator.&nbsp;Leaving things to the market will simply not work, as the experience with the&nbsp;Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) arbitration forum shows. For&nbsp;over a decade now, FINRA has used a rule that requires explained awards only&nbsp;upon joint requests from both parties.— This opt-in mechanism produced “very,&nbsp;very few” actual explained awards.<sup>95</sup> A better design would be to mandate&nbsp;explained awards, or at least set the default differently, so that the parties can opt&nbsp;out of explained awards only upon joint request.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">To emphasize: even if arbitration proceeds with a searchable database of disputes and explained awards, it would probably produce much less law-as-source benefits compared to litigation. Most of the impact that law enforcement&nbsp;has on media coverage comes not so much from the outcomes of disputes, but&nbsp;rather from documents that were produced in earlier stages of the process&nbsp;(discovery, depositions, and so on). Arbitration entails much less information-extracting and would surely be less useful to third parties trying to figure out&nbsp;what and how things happened.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark107"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1060"></a>8.6 Extensions: Arbitration and Reputation&nbsp;in Other Contexts</span></h4>
<p><span class="font21">We started this chapter by noting that the reputational effects of shifting to mandatory arbitration vary greatly across different contexts. This short section&nbsp;goes beyond the context of shareholder litigation, to demonstrate the various&nbsp;factors in play. We specifically focus on the distant context of employment&nbsp;litigation. Mandatory arbitration of workers’ claims has gone through two major&nbsp;changes in recent years: one legal (the Supreme Court’s </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Epic</span><span class="font21"> decision), and one&nbsp;social/cultural (the #MeToo movement). </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Section 8.6.1</span><span class="font21"> explains how the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Epic&nbsp;</span><span class="font21">decision affects the market for reputation. Section </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">8.6.2</span><span class="font21"> looks at the other side,&nbsp;namely, how the market for reputation affects firm’s propensity to adopt&nbsp;mandatory arbitration provisions, following the #MeToo movement.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark1061"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1062"></a>8.6.1 Arbitration of Workplace Claims</span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">; Epic</span><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"> Ramifications</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">In May 2018, the US Supreme Court’s </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Epic</span><span class="font21"> decision enforced arbitration clauses with class waivers in employment contracts.— Large employers were already&nbsp;funneling workplace disputes to arbitration before </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Epic,</span><span class="font21"> and now, when they can&nbsp;effectively eliminate class action, are figured to force such provisions even more&nbsp;aggressively.— Can we apply the argument presented throughout this chapter, in&nbsp;the context of shareholder claims, and similarly make a case against mandatory&nbsp;arbitration in the context of employment claims? Is </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Epic</span><span class="font21"> bad policy?</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The answer is yes, but. Yes, I think that </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Epic</span><span class="font21"> would affect reputational deterrence negatively. But I think its effects would be much different than the&nbsp;ones we analyzed in the context of shareholder litigation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The first difference lies in the “reputation for what” question. While shareholder litigation mostly affects a company’s reputation for quality of&nbsp;governance, employment litigation can also affect a company’s reputation for&nbsp;quality of workplace relations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Another, much more relevant distinction lies in the “reputation to whom” question. The likelihood that information from litigation would translate into&nbsp;reputational sanctions vary across different stakeholder groups. When&nbsp;shareholder litigation reveals information on the checks and balances inside&nbsp;companies, investors are likely to do something with the information. They have&nbsp;too much skin in the game not to. In employment litigation, by contrast, it is&nbsp;much less clear that information from litigation will actually change how&nbsp;stakeholders treat the company. The relevant stakeholder group here is usually&nbsp;employees. And with employees, it is less likely that litigation will tell them&nbsp;something they did not already know about how the company treats its workers.&nbsp;Unlike investors, who suffer as outsiders from asymmetric information and&nbsp;rational apathy, workers are insiders who are directly affected, and have all the&nbsp;incentives and ability to keep informed about the company’s action. These&nbsp;workers rarely rely on litigation for new information. And they often do not need&nbsp;litigation for mobilization either. In unionized areas, the union can engage&nbsp;management either directly or through media pressure. After all, the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Epic&nbsp;</span><span class="font21">decision did not affect workers’ ability to mobilize collectively outside the&nbsp;specific context of class litigation.<sup>98</sup> Even in nonunionized areas, workers can&nbsp;arguably mobilize for their causes and enlist the media via non-litigation&nbsp;channels such as social media, as the Market Basket case study illustrates.<sup>99</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">What about a different stakeholder group, namely, consumers? On paper, information from litigation on how firm X mistreats its employees can lead&nbsp;consumers to buy less from firm X going forward. Indeed, many survey-based&nbsp;studies document consumers’ professed willingness to pay more (less) for the&nbsp;products of companies with good (bad) workplace conditions.<sup>100</sup> Yet I am&nbsp;skeptical that </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Epic</span><span class="font21"> would actually change consumers’ willingness to pay. For&nbsp;one, as </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 5</span><span class="font21"> indicated, evidence shows a gap between consumers’&nbsp;professions in surveys and their actual buying decisions: in reality, consumers&nbsp;purchase based on product quality and price, and little more. And in many of the&nbsp;cases we can summon from memory where consumers were willing to go the&nbsp;distance and boycott a firm for workplace conditions, it was for violations that&nbsp;are not affected by the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Epic</span><span class="font21"> decision at all. The classic example here is issues of&nbsp;child labor in third-world countries, which are not the type of wage-and-hour&nbsp;disputes that would have been litigated in US courtrooms regardless of </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Epic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Still, I conjecture that </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Epic</span><span class="font21"> would have serious reputational ramifications, if only through a different channel: not necessarily through the reputation-for-workplace dimension, but rather through the reputation-for-governance&nbsp;dimension. In other words, ending public dispute resolution of workplace claims&nbsp;can have a detrimental effect on accountability in other areas beside workplace&nbsp;conditions. This is because information from workplace litigation may help&nbsp;expose shenanigans in other aspects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">A timely illustration comes from the Wells Fargo phony-accounts scandal. An investigative report by the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">L.A. Times</span><span class="font21"> broke the story, showing how&nbsp;pressures from the top of the organization led to shady practices of sucker-punching customers and abusing employees.<sup>101</sup> But how was the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">L.A. Times</span><span class="font21"> able&nbsp;to come out with such a story? It turns out that the reporter relied on court&nbsp;documents from wage-and-hours lawsuits filed by disgruntled Wells Fargo&nbsp;employees. A similar, earlier example appears in the Dean Starkman’s book on&nbsp;watchdog business journalism we mentioned earlier: in the 1990s investigative&nbsp;reporters were able to link low-rent operators to Wall Street by trolling&nbsp;employment litigation against financial companies.<sup>102</sup> The court documents&nbsp;provided readymade, libel-proof testimonies by former employees, which&nbsp;detailed the lawless culture in the financial companies in question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Following </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Epic,</span><span class="font21"> such workplace disputes are no longer aired in court. The next time a journalist attempts to expose shenanigans by financial companies,&nbsp;such inside information is more likely to remain out of her reach.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark1063"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1064"></a>8.6.2 How Reputation Affects Arbitration: the #MeToo Example</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">After focusing throughout this chapter on how shifting to arbitration can affect the market for reputation, let us switch to the other side: how the market for&nbsp;reputation can affect the shift to arbitration. When a firm adopts a mandatory&nbsp;arbitration provision, it sends a certain signal to the market. Under certain&nbsp;conditions, stakeholders will view the mere adoption of such provision&nbsp;negatively enough to merit boycotting the firm, and the prospect of a&nbsp;reputational sanction will push firms to drop such provisions or not adopt them&nbsp;to begin with.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">A classic illustration came throughout 2018-19, in the context of law firms’ employment contracts. Initially, law firms followed the mandatory arbitration&nbsp;trend, forcing their summer interns, associates, and administrative staff to sign&nbsp;contracts with such provisions. And they have gotten away with it, until a&nbsp;social-cultural shift made these provisions more salient and objectionable to&nbsp;their employees. In short, the #MeToo movement happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The #MeToo movement increased the saliency of sexual harassment issues. Activist organizations and the media - information intermediaries - started&nbsp;targeting firms who do not do enough to root out sexual harassment. For law&nbsp;firms, specifically, not doing enough about sexual harassment (in our context:&nbsp;trying to force complaints into behind-closed-doors arbitration) started coming&nbsp;with a meaningful reputational risk. The tides turned when a Harvard Law&nbsp;School student group, called the Pipeline Parity Project, started advocating&nbsp;boycotting interviews in firms that force their employees to adhere to such&nbsp;provisions. Fearing reputational damage, one big law firm after another started&nbsp;dropping their mandatory arbitration provisions.<sup>103</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Can the same dynamics - fear of reputational sanctions pushing firms to avoid forcing arbitration - apply elsewhere? I conjecture that it is less realistic&nbsp;outside this specific law-firm-employment context. For one, the issue here is&nbsp;different: sexual harassment is a much more salient issue (at least at the height of&nbsp;the #MeToo movement) than most other contexts in which consumers are forced&nbsp;to sign arbitration provisions without even caring/knowing about them. Further,&nbsp;the target audience is very different: here the target audience - potential&nbsp;employees - are the relatively sophisticated and aware-to-the-dangers-of-arbitration law students.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">It all comes down to solving a collective action problem. For investors in company X, it may be better if company X adopts mandatory arbitration; but for&nbsp;investors as a group, it is better that no company adopts such provision. The&nbsp;increased saliency, low complexity, and levels of engagement by student bodies&nbsp;that we witnessed in the law-firm-employment context usually do not apply in&nbsp;other contexts.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark108"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span class="font21">Five years after the Polinsky and Shavell article that we opened the book with, the movie </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Spotlight</span><span class="font21"> came out. </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Spotlight</span><span class="font21"> won the 2015 Oscar for best film by&nbsp;telling a compelling story about investigative reporters holding the Catholic&nbsp;Church to account over child sex abuse.<sup>1</sup> Yet as I was watching the movie, I&nbsp;could not help but see law-and-reputation themes in almost every scene. The&nbsp;</span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Boston Globos</span><span class="font21"> Spotlight reporters could not have done it alone. The legal&nbsp;system helped them.<sup>2</sup> The </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Globe</span><span class="font21"> reporters spotted the pattern of abuse by&nbsp;looking at numbers of lawsuits filed against individual priests. They revealed the&nbsp;cover-up by getting internal church documents from motions attached to court&nbsp;files. </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Spotlight</span><span class="font21"> is therefore not really a story about investigative journalism&nbsp;holding the powerful to account. It is rather a story about interactions between&nbsp;the media and the courts. Between law and reputation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The interactions are what produced accountability. Without the legal system generating information in the process of examining individual lawsuits against&nbsp;priests, the reporters would not have had such a powerful story to tell. And&nbsp;without the reporters putting the pieces of the puzzle together, identifying the&nbsp;pattern, packaging it compellingly, and diffusing it widely, the church would not&nbsp;have admitted its mistakes and changed its behavior. The legal system would&nbsp;probably have continued settling and sealing one individual case after another. It&nbsp;took media scrutiny to move the needle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">This book develops a theory of these interactions between law and reputation. It fleshes out how and why such interactions occur, and what&nbsp;outcomes they achieve. Once we are aware of the interactions, we can design&nbsp;legal institutions with an eye to their reputation-affecting role.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">It is intuitive to think that decisions and events in the court of law trickle out and affect the court of public opinion, and vice versa. Yet up to this point&nbsp;legal scholars have tended to assume away complementarities between law and&nbsp;reputation, by treating the two systems as independent of each other.<sup>3</sup> </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Law and&nbsp;Reputation</span><span class="font21"> challenges the conventional assumption by mapping the various&nbsp;channels through which the law can influence reputational evaluations, and&nbsp;presenting on-the-ground evidence of such influence. Consider the following&nbsp;data point: communication scientists estimate that between a quarter and a third&nbsp;of the content of business media is dedicated to reporting about companies’&nbsp;interactions with the legal system (regulation, litigation, and corporate&nbsp;governance battles). This data point alone is enough to rid us of the prevalent&nbsp;assumption that law and reputation are independent of each other, and challenge&nbsp;us to start examining how they interact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The rest of this conclusion offers a brief synthesis of the book’s contributions as they relate to existing literature, before outlining potential future&nbsp;extensions of the reputational framework.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark109"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Relation to the Extant Literature</span></h4>
<p><span class="font21">To clarify some of this book’s original contributions, we can juxtapose them with the relevant literature. The Introduction clarified our scope by showing how&nbsp;the questions we are asking differ from the ones that are usually asked in the&nbsp;related literature. This section focuses on how the answers we are providing&nbsp;differ from the ones that others do. The book’s original contributions do </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">not&nbsp;</span><span class="font21">consist in telling us that reputation matters or that the law matters for reputation.&nbsp;We already know that. The contributions consist rather in exploring </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">how</span><span class="font21"> the law&nbsp;matters for reputation. Consider the following four examples of gaps in the&nbsp;conventional approach to law and reputation we have sought to narrow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">First, other legal scholars have written about problems with reputational sanctions (usually in the context of making the case for legal intervention).<sup>4</sup> But&nbsp;the existing analyses focus almost solely on detection costs, suggesting that&nbsp;market players rarely learn about corporate failures in real time. </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Law and&nbsp;Reputation</span><span class="font21"> shows that another set of costs - enforcement costs - also looms&nbsp;large. Even when market players become aware of a certain failure, they may&nbsp;under or overreact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Second, </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Law and Reputation</span><span class="font21"> challenges the conventional economic analyses of law and social norms, which treat behavior as either law-complying&nbsp;or norm-following.</span><span class="font16">5 </span><span class="font21">By spotlighting the existing interdependencies, this book&nbsp;illustrates the need to rethink the conventional approach and its policy&nbsp;implications. We cannot use reputation as a justification for deregulation, at least&nbsp;not automatically. If we scale back the background threat of litigation or&nbsp;regulatory investigations, we risk increasing the costs of reputational sanctions.&nbsp;The issue of complementarities between legal and nonlegal systems should&nbsp;therefore move from the periphery to the center of the law and social norms&nbsp;literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Relatedly, even when legal scholars recognize the costs of legal and nonlegal systems, they usually do so by taking a horse race approach: identifying&nbsp;areas where informal, nonlegal systems are supposedly better (less costly) than&nbsp;formal, legal systems. I refocus the debate by looking at different systems as&nbsp;providing multiple-layers control or, as it were, a diversified portfolio. Each&nbsp;system of control has its own unique set of costs. And because the systems’&nbsp;flaws are imperfectly correlated, a combination of several systems cancels out&nbsp;extreme cases of over- or under-sanctioning. The multiple-layers approach is&nbsp;especially suited to the context of complex, atomized markets, where&nbsp;asymmetric information issues abound and any single system alone cannot&nbsp;govern behavior. In other words, one system of control is usually not enough to&nbsp;hold powerful players to account. It takes a village. Recall the Catholic Church’s&nbsp;cover-up of sexual abuse, or DuPont’s toxic emissions. Only a combination of&nbsp;litigation and media scrutiny was able to stop the continuous harmful behavior.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Finally, </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Law andReputation</span><span class="font21"> highlights the importance of the legal </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">process, </span><span class="font21">and in particular the earlier stages of litigation. The rare extant accounts of the&nbsp;reputational role of the law tend to focus on legal outcomes,<sup>6</sup> whereas I focus on&nbsp;information disseminated in the process of determining legal outcomes. As&nbsp;</span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapters 3</span><span class="font21"> and 4 show, for example, two SEC enforcement actions or Delaware&nbsp;trials with identical legal outcomes may generate completely different&nbsp;reputational outcomes.</span><span class="font16">7 </span><span class="font21">To be sure, I do not claim that my account precludes&nbsp;others. The law produces information in various ways and to various effects. The&nbsp;key is to identify the subsets of cases that are relevant for each type of effect. In&nbsp;corporate law litigation, for example, the filing of a lawsuit or the rendering of a&nbsp;judicial opinion probably generates less reputational impact than the information&nbsp;coming out during the process (such as in the discovery stage or in prediscovery&nbsp;requests to inspect the books). Shifting our attention from the outcomes of legal&nbsp;disputes to the process comes with important implications. If we want to&nbsp;improve information production, we need to rethink seemingly nonsubstantive&nbsp;doctrines such as pleading standards, plaintiffs’ rights to demand inside&nbsp;information in discovery, openness of court proceedings, and the desirability of&nbsp;arbitration clauses.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark110"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Potential Extensions</span></h4>
<p><span class="font21">The interactions between two complex systems such as law and reputation are a vast topic. Accordingly, considerations of brevity and scope have compelled me&nbsp;to leave important angles out of this book, in the hope that future work can&nbsp;address them. Consider the following four specific avenues: engaging in&nbsp;quantitative empirical work to test some of the hypotheses developed here in&nbsp;qualitative methods, elaborating on the hypotheses’ normative implications, and&nbsp;broadening the scope of analysis to incorporate other legal fields and other legal&nbsp;systems.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark1168"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">Empirical Extensions</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">The insights developed here rely on mixed methods, mostly qualitative in nature, such as interviews, case studies, and content analysis. As the Introduction&nbsp;clarified, such methodology makes sense when the aim is to generate hypotheses&nbsp;and indicate the plausibility of the hypotheses - a required step when&nbsp;approaching an undeveloped field. Now that we have chartered the territory of&nbsp;law and reputation, we need to take the next step of building on some of the&nbsp;exploratory work done here and designing more quantitative tests of the&nbsp;hypotheses.<sup>8</sup> As a caveat, I do not claim that my qualitative empirical work here&nbsp;has produced conclusive proofs of my theory or generated external validity in&nbsp;the sense in which the term is used in quantitative studies. What my work has&nbsp;produced, I hope, is a rich theory, one that is valid in the modest sense of prima&nbsp;facie credibility, and that can pave the way for subsequent quantitative probes.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark1169"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">Normative Extensions</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">Reputational forces do not always promote overall welfare. At first glance, this book can be read as too much of a paean to how reputation incentivizes&nbsp;companies to engage in nice behaviors or avoid bad behaviors. A more accurate&nbsp;statement of my claim is that reputational forces incentivize companies to&nbsp;</span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">appear</span><span class="font21"> moral and competent. In the real world, given asymmetric information,&nbsp;corporate insiders sometimes take actions that appear good but are actually&nbsp;detrimental to their agents. The book alludes to such “bad reputation effects,”<sup>9&nbsp;</sup>for example, in the context of how regulators can co-opt court-induced&nbsp;reputational pressures by responding too aggressively or symbolically. But there&nbsp;is room for more detailed analysis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Another avenue for future research on the normative aspects of law and reputation is the phenomenon of </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">reputational spillovers.</span><span class="font21"> We have discussed how&nbsp;legal enforcement actions affect the reputation of defendant companies and&nbsp;businesspeople. But in reality enforcement actions against one company may&nbsp;affect the defendant’s peers as well. Outside stakeholders often do not&nbsp;completely differentiate between peer companies’ reputations. The revelation of&nbsp;bad news about one company may cause stakeholders to lose trust in the whole&nbsp;industry or market.<sup>10</sup> Such dynamics of spillovers and cascades open the door to&nbsp;interesting normative implications. Consider for example an extension of the&nbsp;“make it look like a struggle” idea from </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 3</span><span class="font21">. Counterintuitively, when&nbsp;Delaware courts and the SEC manage to appear tougher than they truly are on&nbsp;corporate America, they may actually promote overall welfare under certain&nbsp;conditions, by containing reputational spillovers. If the public and politicians&nbsp;overreact to isolated corporate failures, then courts that follow a make-it-look-like-a-struggle strategy may help to restore trust in markets without&nbsp;unnecessarily punishing good companies or committing to overregulation.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark1170"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">Other Legal Fields</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">We can also broaden the scope of the law-and-reputation argument by applying it to legal fields we did not cover here. The law generates reputation-shaping&nbsp;effects to various degrees even in seemingly remote areas. The book focused on&nbsp;corporate and securities laws, while also discussing product liability,&nbsp;administrative law, and even labor law applications. Elsewhere I touched on&nbsp;applications to public international law.<sup>11</sup> Future research can further extend the&nbsp;applications to classic private law. Consider two examples that I am currently&nbsp;working on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">In tort law, the reputational perspective can shed light on the long-standing debate of negligence versus strict liability.<sup>12</sup> Conventional economic analysis&nbsp;treats the prevalence of negligence regimes as a puzzle: on paper, a strict-liability rule would be preferable as it leads to optimal activity levels. Such an&nbsp;analysis assumes that liability rules affect behavior only directly, through&nbsp;imposing legal sanctions. Yet, as this book showed, liability rules can also affect&nbsp;behavior through producing information. Take medical malpractice, for&nbsp;example. Litigation under a negligence regime produces reputation-relevant&nbsp;information, such as whether the facility was properly maintained, or whether&nbsp;the doctor used the most up-to-date methods. It gives outside observers&nbsp;information that they can use to evaluate whether the problem is indicative of&nbsp;future behavior or not. Do I want to be hospitalized in this facility or operated on&nbsp;by this doctor or not? Litigation under strict liability, by contrast, does not focus&nbsp;on how things happened but only on what happened. It produces much less&nbsp;reputation-relevant information. In that way, negligence regimes affect the&nbsp;activity levels too, albeit indirectly: by producing information, they dictate how&nbsp;many future patients will go to the doctor in question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">In contract law, the reputational perspective spotlights a counterintuitive problem in the shift to personalized contracts.— Sellers increasingly rely on big&nbsp;data and predictive analytics to identify potential “nudnik” consumers: those&nbsp;consumers who are more likely to voice concerns publicly, such as posting&nbsp;detailed negative reviews online, enlisting the help of the media, or complaining&nbsp;to the regulator. This small group of consumers is an engine of market&nbsp;discipline. They are the ones generating most of the reputation-relevant&nbsp;information on sellers. While most of us do not even notice when we are&nbsp;overcharged by $4 on a takeout order, these nudniks do, and their activism holds&nbsp;sellers accountable. Yet if sellers can now identify who is a nudnik before that&nbsp;consumer even steps into their store, they can effectively silence the nudnik or&nbsp;avoid selling to her altogether. In other words, an unexplored dark side of big&nbsp;data is that it can be used to reduce the expected reputational sanction for&nbsp;overcharging, mistreating a customer, or selling a defective product. This&nbsp;technology is good for companies. It may actually be good for the targeted&nbsp;consumer herself, because sellers often offer her preferential treatment. Yet it is&nbsp;bad for the market overall. Legal intervention may be needed to protect the&nbsp;market for seller reputation.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark1171"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">Other Legal Systems</span></h5>
<p><span class="font21">Another fertile ground for future research is the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">comparative</span><span class="font21"> aspects of law and reputation. The examples used throughout the book come mainly from US law.&nbsp;Some of the reason for this is practical: the United States is where I studied,&nbsp;taught, and consulted on law and reputation when I was formulating my ideas.&nbsp;But there is also substantive reason to focus on the United States: the American&nbsp;legal system is more geared toward information production than any other legal&nbsp;system in the world. For one, discovery is the most far-reaching.<sup>14</sup> And plaintiffs&nbsp;and their lawyers enjoy high-powered economic incentives to extract&nbsp;information: the bounty is higher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Yet, while the reputational effects of the law may be strongest in the United States, logic and anecdotal examples suggest that they apply to some extent in&nbsp;other systems as well. When Oxford’s John Armour was assigned to comment&nbsp;on my law-as-source project, he did his own digging, and found that legal&nbsp;sources were indeed behind over half of the top investigative projects in the&nbsp;United Kingdom as well. And in a current project where I examine Israel’s move&nbsp;to a Delaware-style business court, the early findings are in line with what we&nbsp;saw in </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 3</span><span class="font21">: the biggest change from moving to Delaware-style&nbsp;adjudication is not in substantive law but rather in the more intensive media&nbsp;coverage and the reputational effects of the legal disputes. The new business&nbsp;court shapes behavior mainly indirectly. In other, non-common-law systems, the&nbsp;reputational effects seem to be more limited. In Germany, for example, the&nbsp;names of the disputants are confidential. This takes away the ability of&nbsp;investigative reporters to cull court documents to find patterns of misbehavior, as&nbsp;elaborated in </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 7</span><span class="font21">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Along these lines, a promising venue for comparative inquiry is to apply the reputational framework to the “what matters” debate that has been dominating&nbsp;the law and finance literature since the 1990s. The extant literature has been&nbsp;trying to locate the determinants of strong corporate governance and capital&nbsp;markets, searching for systematic differences in either legal, market, or social&nbsp;controls across countries. Yet one important difference has been left relatively&nbsp;understudied: the differences in interactions between systems of control. The&nbsp;reputational perspective suggests the possibility that the variation in outcomes&nbsp;across countries is driven not just by how each system functions in isolation, but&nbsp;also by how the systems affect each other. Systems of control can facilitate each&nbsp;other in one country while crowding each other out in another country.&nbsp;Specifically, when measuring the effectiveness of legal enforcement, we should&nbsp;try to capture the indirect effects too, by asking whether the legal system&nbsp;facilitates better nonlegal controls.<sup>15</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">My initial conjecture is that countries with adjudication systems that provide quality information to the market can afford to rely more heavily on&nbsp;market solutions. This is because litigation (or regulatory investigations) that&nbsp;provide information in a timely, accessible, and accurate manner facilitates&nbsp;better reputational control. Such a perspective suggests a new explanation for the&nbsp;relative strength of US corporate governance. Perhaps the genius of American&nbsp;corporate law comes not from well-designed and strictly enforced substantive&nbsp;rules, but rather from civil procedure rules that are geared toward information&nbsp;production.<sup>16</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font21">***</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">This book centers around one overarching point: the law shapes behavior not just through imposing sanctions, but also through producing information. In the&nbsp;course of fleshing out this point and examining the interactions between law and&nbsp;reputation, the book contributes to various debates that have been at the center of&nbsp;academics’ and practitioners’ attention, such as the desirability of heightened&nbsp;pleading standards or mandatory arbitration clauses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Delving into the interconnections between law and reputation also sheds new light on age-old policy debates. Two binary camps have been dominating&nbsp;the debate over legal intervention: one camp advocates “leaving things to the&nbsp;market” while the other calls for “ramping up legal sanctioning.” Yet those who&nbsp;oppose legal intervention fail to recognize the importance of the legal system for&nbsp;the functioning of market discipline. And those who advocate for more legal&nbsp;sanctions fail to recognize the ability of the legal system to shape behavior&nbsp;</span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">indirectly,</span><span class="font21"> without interfering with business decisions. Sometimes the most&nbsp;effective and realistic way to promote deterrence is not to increase legal&nbsp;sanctions, but to increase the quantity and quality of information production.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark1188"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Appendix A </span><span class="font25" style="font-style:italic;">Interviews</span></h2>
<p><span class="font21">To capture the fuzzy dynamics of how law affects reputation, I conducted in-depth open conversational interviews with veteran journalists, reputation consultants, and litigators. In this type of interview, the researcher introduces a&nbsp;topic in broad strokes, the interviewee talks freely about the interviewee’s&nbsp;experience and insights into the topic, and the researcher further probes specific&nbsp;experiences with follow-up questions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The interviews played an especially important part in </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 2</span><span class="font21">'s insights on how the law affects investigative reporting. As a way to introduce the topic, I&nbsp;started all interviews with the same research question, namely, “What role do&nbsp;you think that legal sources play in investigative reporting?” I also included in&nbsp;almost every interview some questions about variation across issues and over&nbsp;time, such as “Is it harder as a reporter to hold big government to account than it&nbsp;is to hold big business to account, or vice versa?,” and “How have the legal&nbsp;sourcing dynamics you just described changed over time?” When interviewing&nbsp;Pulitzer winners, I asked them specifically, “What role did legal sources play in&nbsp;your [winning project]?” and we went into detail and clarifications.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The interviewing is of course subject to biases. Your interviewees may tell you what they think you want to hear or distort their responses to boost their&nbsp;image. Two factors alleviate such concerns here. First, as </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 2</span><span class="font21"> noted, the&nbsp;insights presented here are based on triangulation: not just what journalists say&nbsp;about legal sources when they talk with me, but also what they say when they&nbsp;talk with themselves (tip sheets/syllabi), and what they actually do (content&nbsp;analysis). Second, overstating the role of legal sources is actually the opposite of&nbsp;what a journalist who wishes to boost her image would do. If a journalist tilts her&nbsp;answers in a self-serving way, why would she suggest that she merely&nbsp;piggybacked existing public documents? She is better off claiming more credit&nbsp;to her hard-working, developing-ears-on-the-streets efforts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">In compiling the sample of interviewees, I focused on two groups. For the first batch of interviews I approached journalists who served or are currently&nbsp;serving in big-picture-type positions: directors and founders of investigative&nbsp;reporting centers, heads of academic units of investigative reporting, veteran&nbsp;editors, and so on. I made a concerted effort to approach reporters with varied&nbsp;experiences - as reporters and editors, in broadcast and print media, covering the&nbsp;financial market beat and covering criminal cases, and so forth. The second&nbsp;batch of interviewees were winners of the Pulitzer Prize for Investigative&nbsp;Reporting in 1995-2015. In both groups, roughly two-thirds of the journalists I&nbsp;approached agreed to interview for this project.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Table A1</span><span class="font21"> details the interviews of the law-as-source study. Unless noted otherwise, I conducted the interviews by phone. I then list some of the most&nbsp;helpful and influential interviews I have had in the earlier stages of formulating&nbsp;this book’s thesis.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark1208"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Appendix B </span><span class="font25" style="font-style:italic;">Content Analysis</span></h3>
<p><span class="font21">Aside from interviews, the book rests heavily also on content analysis of media coverage. In particular, </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 2</span><span class="font21"> presents content analysis of prizewinning&nbsp;investigative reports. This Appendix describes the process.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Sample</span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">:</span><span class="font21"> The reason for focusing on Pulitzers and IRE medals is twofold: relevance and convenience. Pulitzers and IRE medals are considered extremely&nbsp;prestigious by the general public and investigative reporters themselves.&nbsp;Sampling such awards gives us a window into standard-setting and impactful&nbsp;investigative reporting. Further, both awards make all relevant parts of a winning&nbsp;project publicly available online, and in many cases contain the entry letter&nbsp;submitted by the newspaper, thereby making it more convenient to figure out&nbsp;how the story came about.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Identifying Sources</span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">:</span><span class="font19"> To identify the sources of Pulitzer-winning stories we </span><span class="font21">read every entry for each project. A few entries made our task straightforward,&nbsp;explicitly mentioning from the outset how they came up with the story. Most&nbsp;entries, however, drop occasional, sometimes implicit references to sources&nbsp;throughout the project. After all, when journalists write a story, they normally do&nbsp;not start with deep confessions of where they found the information, but rather&nbsp;focus on the story itself. Therefore, locating the sources necessitated careful&nbsp;reading of all the entries. In most cases, we found indications of sourcing&nbsp;incidentally: there would be a lengthy paragraph detailing who did what to&nbsp;whom, which ended in a “the depositions show” phrase. Identifying the sources&nbsp;of IRE-winning stories, by contrast, was straightforward: the IRE database&nbsp;contains not just the finished products (the investigative reports), but also the&nbsp;prize applications forms, where the applicants explicitly detail how their story&nbsp;came about.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">We then had to pinpoint the sources that would be considered “legal documents,” as opposed to any other public record. To be sure, the distinction is&nbsp;murky. It is best illustrated by the famous Watergate story. In popular culture,&nbsp;Watergate is associated with human sources - tips from “deep throat.” Yet the&nbsp;investigative project actually started when a journalist that covered the police&nbsp;beat went over logs of overnight arrests, and stumbled upon a suspicion that&nbsp;started the digging. For our purposes, going over police logs to find leads does&nbsp;</span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font21"> count as relying on a legal source. What happened later in the story (i.e.&nbsp;when Woodward and Bernstein used documents subpoenaed by law enforcement&nbsp;officers to show how the break-in was connected to higher-ups) does.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Weighting Sources</span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">:</span><span class="font19"> Assigning weights to legal sources’ contributions to a </span><span class="font21">project is complicated by the fact that most winning projects have multiple parts,&nbsp;covering different angles of the topic. Each part can rely on varying mixes of&nbsp;sources. </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">Part 1</span><span class="font21"> of a project may rest on information attained by FOIA requests,&nbsp;while </span><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">parts 2</span><span class="font21">-4 may be based on interviews, and part 5 may draw from&nbsp;depositions. We judged the relative weight of legal sources based on each part’s&nbsp;contribution to the overall story and its impact. In most cases, the judgment was&nbsp;made easier by the fact that the Pulitzer committee already narrowed down the&nbsp;articles that are considered a part of the winning projects, listing only the most&nbsp;impactful ones. If the Pulitzer committee identified these parts as essential to the&nbsp;project, we could usually infer that indications of strong reliance on legal</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">sources there meant that legal sources played a strong role in the project as a whole.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Reliability</span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">:</span><span class="font21"> My analysis of prizewinning investigative projects rested on human-based content analysis. Human analysis is generally considered to&nbsp;increase the validity of analysis but decrease the reliability (relative to computer-based content analysis). In our case of having to code legal sources’ roles, three&nbsp;factors mitigate potential problems with reliability. First, unlike in projects with&nbsp;larger samples where coding is assigned to research assistants, in our smaller,&nbsp;exploratory-style sample, I personally coded all entries. Second, I was not the&nbsp;only coder - at least one research assistant separately examined each&nbsp;prizewinning project, and the agreement among us (the intercoder reliability)&nbsp;was relatively high: 0.81. Third, with respect to Pulitzers, I managed to talk with&nbsp;the prizewinning journalist in seventeen out of the twenty-five sampled projects,&nbsp;and directly asked them about the role legal sources played in their reports.&nbsp;Asking the journalists increased the reliability of the specific seventeen projects&nbsp;and, more generally, put our coding to the test. We coded all stories before&nbsp;talking to the prizewinning reporters, and so when their answers confirmed that&nbsp;our coding was accurate in thirteen of the seventeen stories, and actually slightly&nbsp;understated the role of legal sources in three more of the stories, it provided&nbsp;another reason to believe that we did not overstate the role of law as source.</span></p>
